The first will present different definitions of the word “architecture,” and discuss the notion of different views one can \\ntake on an architecture. The second part overviews the three different space \\ncommunities: commercial, civil and military. The third part contains descriptions of \\nspace architectures, and concludes by reviewing different classes of space missions and \\ntheir typical architectures. Part 1 \\nDefinition of Architecture \\nThere are many different definitions of the word architecture, and which definition is \\nmost appropriate in any situation is largely context-specific. To start, Webster’s \\nDictionary states architecture is a “formation or construction as or as if as the result of \\nconscious act,” or “a unifying or coherent form or structure.”1 From a product \\ndevelopment perspective, Ulrich and Eppinger offer that an architecture is an “arrangement of the functional elements into physical blocks.”\\n2 From a mechanical \\nsystems design perspective, Frey suggests architecture is the “structure, arrangements or configuration of system elements and their internal relationships necessary to satisfy \\nconstraints and requirements.”\\n3 Looking across different types of products and systems, \\nCrawley thinks architecture is the “embodiment of concept, and the allocation of physical/informational function to elements of form, and definition of interfaces among \\nthe elements and with the surrounding context.”\\n4 Further applying the word architecture \\nat an Engineering Systems level, the ESD Architecture Committee defines system architecture as “an abstract description of the entities of a system and the relationships \\nbetween those entities.”\\n5 \\nThese different definitions all share several things in common, including the sense of an \\narchitecture being composed of parts that work together or interact together in some \\nfashion. The specifics of what those parts are, and how precisely they are connected, can \\nbe unique to each domain of application of the term architecture . \\nDifferent Views of an Architecture \\nEvery system can be thought of as having an architecture, but there are many different \\nviews or representations of that architecture that can be conceived. Levis (1999) suggests \\nthat there are four main views of an architecture: \\n•\\t“The functional  architecture (a partially ordered list of activities or functions that \\nare needed to accomplish the system’s requirements) \\n•\\tThe physical  architecture (at minimum a node-arc representation of physical \\nresources and their interconnections) \\n•\\tThe technical  architecture (an elaboration of the physical architecture that \\ncomprises a minimal set of rules governing the arrangement, interconnections, and interdependence of the elements, such that the system will achieve the \\nrequirements) \\n1 Miriam-Webster Online Dictionary, \\n2 Ulrich, Karl T., and Steven D. Eppinger. 2000. Product Design and Development, 2nd ed. New York:\\nIrwin/McGraw-Hill.\\n3 Need Dan’s paper citation here\\n4 Crawley, Ed. 2003 ESD.34 Lecture Notes, Lecture 1, page 15.\\n5 Crawley, Ed et al. 2004. “The Influence of Architecture in Engineering Systems,” in Engineering\\nSystems Monograph of the Engineering Systems Symposium, March 29-31, MIT, Cambridge, MA.\\n•\\tThe dynamic operational  architecture (a description of how the elements operate \\nand interact over time while achieving the goals)”6 \\nIn addition to these four views, which are very typical of a military perspective on \\narchitecture, one can imagine that an informational architecture showing what \\ninformation content is passed between parts of the architecture could be a very useful view of an architecture. Similarly, especially with respect to large Engineering Systems, \\nan organizational architecture describing the groups of people involved in an \\narchitecture, what system responsibilities they have, what inputs they need and what \\noutputs they produce, can help understand stakeholder interactions and relationships in an \\narchitecture. \\nPart 2 \\nCommunities that Use Space Systems \\nGenerally, world-wide use of space systems is broken down into three user communities: Commercial, Civil and Military. Each of these communities share common needs, \\ninterests, and uses of space systems and services. \\nCommercial \\nThe commercial space community is composed of those for-profit companies that provide services in, from or enabled by space. Typically, the commercial companies are \\nonly interested in fielding services that will be profitable. The commercial space user \\ncommunity today is primarily interested in broadcast communications, point-to-point \\ncommunications, position and navigation services, and imagery. DirecTV, XM Satellite \\nRadio, and Digital Cinema are examples of broadcast communications, while Iridium \\nphones and Connexion in-flight internet services are examples of point-to-point \\ncommunications. Commercial GPS receivers are produced for applications ranging from \\nrecreational boating to precision farming, and many areas in between. While still a \\nyoung and small business, commercial imagery companies such as Space Imaging and \\nDigital Globe, provide visual spectrum pictures of locations nearly worldwide. \\nCivil \\nThe civil space community is composed of non-military and non-intelligence government \\nagencies that use space. In the U.S., the largest civil organizations engaged in space are \\nNASA and NOAA. NASA is charged with exploring space, doing science missions \\nfocusing on the earth and our solar system, and developing technology for use in space. \\nNOAA is responsible for weather monitoring and forecasting, which relies heavily on \\nspace-based assets. Also involved in the civil space community are the FAA (space -\\nbased navigation for airplanes and remote airports) and the USGS (space-based mapping and measurements). \\n6 Ibid. Military \\nThe military space community is composed of the armed forces and the intelligence \\nagencies that use space as a medium from which to gather information or as an \\nenvironment in which to execute operations. Intelligence users are interested in \\nemploying satellites to monitor activities in denied areas. Military users are interested in \\nsatellites to help with navigation, weather forecasting, and worldwide communication, in \\naddition to intelligence gathering to support specific military engagements. \\nPart 3 \\nSpace Architectures \\nWhile there are different kinds of space architectures, they all have several components in \\ncommon. Typically, a space architecture can be broken down into main three physical \\nparts: the space segment, the launch segment, and ground segment. The satellites contain \\nthe payloads that will accomplish the primary mission, as well as a bus that provides the \\ninfrastructure for operating the payload. The launch vehicles transport the satellites to \\norbit. The ground segment consists of gateways where data is downlinked from satellites \\n(the moniker of “ground segment” notwithstanding, sometimes these gateways can be \\nlocated in space), as well as processing and distribution facilities to put the raw data in \\nthe appropriate form and location for users. \\nThe space segment can be either a single satellite or a constellation of satellites in the \\nsame or multiple orbits. In turn, each satellite can be monolithic, with all its payload and \\nbus equipment on the same physical structure, or distributed, with its payload and bus \\nfunctions split among more than one physical structure. To date, most satellites have \\nbeen monolithic in nature. Work on distributed satellites has been largely theoretical, \\nwith very limited technology demonstration. \\nThe launch segment can be relatively simple for a single satellite architecture, or very \\nintricate for a many-satellite architecture (like Iridium, or GPS). For space architectures \\nwith multiple satellites, the launch segment can receive significant attention, and plays an \\nimportant role in mission risk reduction and constellation replenishment and maintenance \\nstrategies. \\nThe ground segment often includes a choice of whether to use data downlink gateway \\nsystems in space (i.e. TDRSS) or on the earth (i.e. the Deep Space Network, or AFSCN). \\nAlso of consideration is where data processing will take place, and how mission data will \\nbe stored and distributed. For a space system taking high resolution imagery, assuming it \\ntakes 50 pictures of 500mb each, every day, for 10 years, that leaves a system architect \\nwith a whopping 91 terabytes of information to store. That’s nearly the equivalent of the \\nentire contents of the U.S. Library of Congress, and not a trivial amount of data to \\naccommodate. Classes of Space Systems \\nGenerally, we can classify space systems by the mission they perform. Each mission also \\ngenerally has a characteristic architecture, which is described below in this final section. \\nCommunication \\nCommunication space systems provide broadcast (i.e. DirecTV) or point-to-point (i.e. \\nIridium) communication services to users around the globe, as well as data and voice \\nrelay between spacecraft in orbit and controllers on the ground (i.e. TDRSS). Broadcast \\nmissions typically have a set region on the earth to which they are broadcasting, and \\ntypically utilization geostationary orbits and a single satellite to cover a single region, or \\nfour satellites in GEO to provide worldwide broadcast coverage. Point-to-point missions \\nare typically accomplished with either one or several GEO satellites (like the broadcast \\nmission), or with a MEO or LEO constellation of 10 to dozens of satellites that provides \\nadequate coverage for the system’s geographical mission area. Communication missions \\nthat relay data between space and the earth typically use GEO satellites. \\nPositioning and Navigation \\nPositioning and navigation (POS/NAV) missions typically provide near global coverage and use triangulation as a strategy to provide the POS/NAV service. Thus, multiple \\nsatellites need to be in view of a ground receiver at any point in time, leading architects to \\nuse MEO orbits. Currently, the U.S. fields GPS, and the Russians field Glonass. The \\nEuropean community is in the planning stages of their Galileo POS/NAV satellite \\nsystem, and will likely field it later this decade. \\nWeather \\nWeather missions typically utilize two different kinds of space system architectures. One \\narchitecture uses GEO satellites, but these do not provide adequate coverage near for \\nhigher latitudes. The other architecture uses polar orbiting satellites, which provide \\ncoverage to the higher latitude areas of the globe that GEO satellites cannot see well \\nenough. \\nRemote Sensing \\nBroadly speaking, remote sensing satellite mission use sensors to collect data of many sorts from the earth’s surface. These data could produce visual spectrum images, IR \\nspectrum images, elevation measurement, atmospheric gas measurement, ocean states, \\nand the list goes on and on. The architecture of remote sensing missions largely depends \\non the frequency and range of coverage required, as well as strength of the signal being \\nsensed. For persistent coverage in a fixed small area with a strong signal, GEO satellites \\ncan work well. For infrequent coverage of a large area with a weaker signal, a single of \\nmultiple LEO satellites might be a good choice. \\nLaunch \\nThe launch mission differs dramatically from the previous four missions, and is an \\nenabler for accomplishing them. Architectures of the launch vehicle itself (which is \\ndifferent than a launch architecture for a satellite) may be expendable or reusable, single or multiple stages, solid or liquid propellant, and support different inclinations and orbital \\naltitudes as a function of its launch site(s). Often, the launch vehicle architecture is a \\ncombination of all these different choices, selected to optimize performance for a given \\nset of requirements the launch vehicle will serve. '),\n",

The satellite and ground segment are often independently- developed so that confirmation of mutual understanding between those two segments is a challenge. However, it is an essential step, as it is needed to verify whether the satellite in orbit has ability to communicate with the ground segment on ground. DHS interfaces are critical. It may be easy to confirm physical interfaces, however, confirmation of logical interfaces is not. The risk of that those interfaces do not work well, is not small, especially, for the case of a new DHS system development. To reduce the risk, those interfaces should be confirmed as soon as possible. If this confirmation is done when the integration of two segments are completed, and the result shows that those interfaces have problems, it will take a lot of steps back and forth to identify and fix the problems.    For decades, a lot of approaches have been developed and introduced for testing DHS interfaces between satellite and ground segment. Some approaches have offered great ways to design and verify DHS. However, these approaches still miss to introduce systematic methodology to identify how upper layers of DHS interfaces can be verified at low-level testing, before system-level tests.    In this research, I am about to propose a new approach to satellite data handling system design for architectural-layer-driven verification. In this approach, processes of architecture design and verification of data handling system are to be introduced in systematic way. DHS architecture is categorized into two types according to different viewpoints of design. One of two types, “vertical” architecture, is designed to illustrate upper layer interfaces, which cannot be shown in the other type, “horizontal” architecture. This way of architecture design supports verification of DHS upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing, thus, objective of the research, reduction of  II development risks and iteration testing processes. Before experienced engineers have been trying to test these interfaces based on their experience without any explicit systematic way. Evaluation of the approach is to be done by applying the approach to MicroDragon satellite developed by Vietnam National Satellite Center (VNSC), and to a data relay satellite system, and by interviewing five satellite specialists.

Research Background 1.1.1. Overview of satellite and ground segment 1.1.1.1. Overview of satellite A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. In fact, the word \"satellite\" commonly refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space [1].  \\n Figure 1. Satellites of NASA to study the oceans, land, and atmosphere [credits: NASA]  Satellites are developed in different shapes and sizes. Normally, one satellite consists of two parts including payload and bus. Payload instruments are used for implementing missions such as taking pictures, collecting weather information, etc. while bus components are assigned to some functions for controlling and maintaining operations of the satellite, such as, supplying electrical power, controlling temperature, protecting satellite from space environment, controlling and determining satellite attitude, receiving command from ground, sending back data to ground, controlling and managing operational activities.  \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 2 \\nAs it is shown in Figure 2, one satellite commonly is composed of some subsystems which are assigned to specific functions, including Command & Data Handling system (C&DH), Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS), Mission subsystem (MIS), Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), Structure subsystem (STR), Thermal subsystem (THR), and Communication subsystem (COM).  Figure 2. Common subsystems of a satellite  Satellites are launched into space by rockets. One satellite orbits the earth when the centrifugal force proportional to its speed is balanced by gravitational force caused by earth gravity. The satellite can travel around the earth in different altitude, different orbit shapes (circle or ellipse), and different orbital inclination compared with equator plane. Two common orbits are geostationary orbit and polar orbit. Geostationary satellites travel from west to east over the equator at altitude of 35,786km. They spin around the earth at the same spinning rate of the earth, therefore it seems that one geostationary satellite does not move if looking from ground. That is the reason geostationary satellites are usually designed to observe or cover one specific area on ground. Polar orbit is nearly perpendicular to equator plane. As the earth is self-spinning, polar-orbiting satellites can scan the whole globe when they travel from pole to pole. To end life of one satellite, one way is that the satellite falls to the earth and be burnt by friction caused by the earth atmosphere. The other way is that it transfers its orbit to one disposal orbit, for geostationary satellites, disposal orbit is a few hundred kilometers about their operational orbit. Nowadays, satellite-based applications and services grow strongly because of advantages of satellite-based technologies compared with ground-based technologies such as coverage, real-time properties, speed particularly, ability of remote sensing, communication, weather forecast, to name a few. With space technology, human can observe larger areas at one time, in other words, the satellite can collect more data, more quickly than ground-based instruments. For communication, the satellite can receive \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 3 \\ntelevision and phone calls signals then distributes to different locations on the earth.  As it is indicated in Figure 3, number of satellites launched in 2014 increased 4 times from 2005 to 2014, especially it was 12 times in case of commercial satellites. \\n Figure 3. Number of Spacecraft launched from 2005 to 2014 [2] 1.1.1.2. Overview of ground segment \\n Figure 4. An example of ground segment In order to operate the satellite as well as collecting data, it is necessary to have ground segment on ground. One ground segment usually includes a mission control center and one or more ground stations (including antennas and antenna control station), as it is illustrated in Figure 4. \\nGround Segment \\nGround Station \\nMission Control Center \\nAntennas \\nTracking system \\nOperations Control & Monitor \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nData Storage \\nData Processing \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 4 \\n A mission control center is a facility that manages space flights, usually from the point of launch until landing or the end of the mission. A staff of flight controllers and other support personnel monitor all aspects of the mission using telemetry, and sending commands to the vehicle using ground stations. Personnel supporting the mission from a mission control center can include members of C&DH, ADCS, THR, MIS, COM, and EPS subsystem. One example of the mission control center is the mission control center of international space station (ISS), shown in Figure 5. A ground station (GS) includes antennas, which are used for transmitting data between the ground segment and the satellite, and a system for tracking the satellite and controlling the antennas. The antennas can be categorized into different groups depending on frequency of electromagnetic wave which carry the data, for example, X-band antenna, S-band antenna, C-band antenna, Ku-band antenna, to name a few.  \\n Figure 5. International Space Station control room in Russia Ground station antennas have a parabolic shape to increase possibilities of receiving electromagnetic signals from satellites. These signals can carry data or can be used for broadcasting. One parabolic antenna is designed to receive and transmit signals in specific frequency ranges, for example S-band antenna is used for S-band signals.  Figure 6 illustrates one ground station of Galileo satellites located in Redu, Belgium. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 5 \\n Figure 6. Ground station of Galileo satellites in Redu, Belgium 1.1.2. Introduction to satellite Data Handling System 1.1.2.1. Introduction to data handling system A satellite development project usually requires a great budget and other resources including human resources and facilities. However, many countries still want to spend a lot of money and effort on developing and launching the satellite because sometimes, it is necessary to collect data and information in real-time with bigger amount, and with as big coverage as possible, for example collecting weather information for agriculture development, disaster monitoring, communications, navigations, etc. As mentioned in the previous section, to acquire the data and information from satellites, it needs the ground segment.  The data exchange system between flight segment and ground segment is defined in this thesis as Data Handling System (DHS). Figure 7 illustrates one example of data handling system.  In Figure 7, data handling system is responsible for collecting data in the satellite, followed by downlink these data to ground station, as well as generating and uplink command from ground station to operate the satellite. In general, data handling system is in charge of all the processes/ tasks related to data in the satellite and the ground segment. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 6 \\n Figure 7. An example of Data Handling System between satellite and ground segment Data handling system operates based on communication subsystem in the satellite and in the ground segment. The communication subsystem is responsible for transmitting data between two segments, yet, it does not care about the content of data instead it only takes care of success of transmission. While DHS takes responsibility for that whether data received at one end, is exactly the same data sent from the other end. In other words, DHS takes care of all the data handling processes including data collection, data packet, data encryption, data processing, data decryption, data distribution, and data transmission. If one of these processes fails, DHS will fail. There are three types of data going through DHS between satellite and ground segment including: • Telemetry (housekeeping data) or health status information of the satellite: is defined as state information of satellite components. For example, ON/OFF status of a camera, temperature of onboard computer, current/ voltage of battery, etc. • Command: are requests from ground station to take actions or change status of satellite components. For example, turn ON/OFF cameras, switch modes from coarse earth acquisition mode to fine earth acquisition mode, capture images, start data downlink, etc. Command is categorized into some groups, depending on execution timing and command structure, as shown in Table 1. Combining them together, four types of command can be created, including single real-time command, block real-time command, single timeline command, and block timeline command. A single command executes single tasks, for example, turning on a camera. A \\nC&DH \\nADCS \\nMIS \\nOthers Subsystem \\nCOM \\nGS \\nMCC Satellite Ground Segment \\nData Handling System \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 7 \\nblock command is a combination of single commands, performing a task, which requires multiple steps. For example, Figure 8 illustrates a block command which is sent from the ground station to the satellite to capture the pictures, is composed of 3 single commands including turn on camera à\\uf0e0 take one picture à\\uf0e0 turn off camera.                  Table 1. List of command types  Single Block Real-time Single real-time command Block real-time command Timeline Single timeline command Block timeline command  \\n       Figure 8. An example of a taking-picture block command A real-time command is executed as soon as the satellite receives it from the ground station. As it illustrated in Figure 9, a timeline command is sent from ground station with time-to-execute information. The timeline command is normally used for the case when the ground station cannot see and communicate with the satellite. For example, the satellite has to take a picture of an area, however, at the time, the ground station cannot communicate with the satellite to send the command, thus, a timeline command is necessary in this situation. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 8 \\n               Figure 9. Execution of a timeline command • Mission data: are data acquired from mission payload instruments of the satellite, for example images of ocean, atmosphere temperature information, atmosphere humidity information, etc. To name one example, one satellite operational activity is described as follows. The ground station sends a block timeline command via uplink to tell the satellite to take pictures of a specific area on ground (the time when the satellite travels above the area to take the pictures is identified based on orbit calculation). When the satellite is above the area (at specified time), the satellite attitude will be determined and controlled appropriately, and the cameras will be turned on and take pictures of the area, then image data will be sent to and stored in the onboard computer. During the time that the satellite can be seen from the ground station, the satellite will send both telemetry and mission data via downlink to the ground station. In the ground station, the data are processed and sent to end-users. 1.1.2.2. Data handling system lifecycle Figure 10 illustrates the lifecycle of satellite DHS, which is divided into two phases: development phase and operations phase. The development phase starts from system requirements à\\uf0e0 system design à\\uf0e0 manufacture à\\uf0e0 verification and validation. In DHS development phase, the satellite or/and ground segment, are under development. As both segments are usually developed independently, it is difficult to confirm mutual understanding between those two segments. However, it is an essential step to verify whether the satellite in orbit has ability to talk with the ground segment on ground. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 9 \\nTherefore, verification of system interfaces is very important, particularly for development of data handling system. If upper-layer interfaces of data handling system can be determined and verified in low-level system development phase, it can reduce development risks by reducing unexpected iteration testing processes. The context and the way, which data handling system operates in operations phase affects how this system is developed in development phase. \\n Figure 10. Lifecycle of satellite data handling system As one ground segment is not designed for only one satellite, thus, its lifecycle is normally longer than that of the satellite. Therefore, the lifecycle of DHS is associated with the lifecycle of the satellite. The operations phase of DHS starts as soon as satellite communication starts, it is the moment right after seperation of the satellite from the rocket, and ends when the satellite finishes its life. 1.1.3. Introduction to MicroDragon satellite MicroDragon is a micro-class satellite of which weight and size are 50 kg, and 50cm x 50cm x 50cm, respectively. Figure 11 is a 3D-image of MicroDragon satellite. The satellite has four cameras categorized into two types: Space-borne Multispectral Imager (SMI), and Triple Polarization Imager (TPI). In addition, there are two secondary payloads developed at Kyushu Institute of Technology named Antimony Tin Oxide Coating Solar Cell (ATOCSC), and Atomic Oxygen Sample (AOS). As scheduled, the satellite is to be launched in 2018 by EPSILON rocket of Japan \\nAfter separation \\nNominal operations \\nEnd of operations \\nNominal Operations \\nInitial operation       \\nCOM starts \\nTLM/CMD \\nNominal operation       \\nCOM’s in operations \\nTLM/CMD/ Mission data \\nEnd of operation       \\nCOM ends \\nTLM/CMD \\nUnder development       \\nCOM \\nTLM/CMD/ Mission data \\nUnder development \\nUnder development \\nSatellite DHS Ground Segment Development Phase Operations Phase  Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 10 \\nAerospace Exploration Agency. The mission objective of MicroDragon satellite is to observe color of water in Vietnamese ocean areas in order to assess coastal water quality and locate aquatic creatures. The system will provide collected data for researchers and scientists in fishery field and oceanography for analysis and after that they will distribute necessary information to fishermen and environmental managers.  \\n Figure 11.  3D-Image of MicroDragon satellite Viet Nam has a coastline of 3,260 km that crosses 13 latitudes, from 8°23\\'N to 21°39\\'N. There are four main fishing areas: Gulf of Tonkin, shared with China; Central Vietnam; Southeastern Vietnam; and Southwestern Vietnam (part of Gulf of Thailand), shared with Cambodia and Thailand. Apart from these geographical zones, the fishing areas can be divided in inshore-coastal fishery and offshore fishery. Inshore water is considered as the water with the depth of less than 30m in the Tonkin Gulf and the South, and of less than 50m in the center of Vietnam. Vietnam has huge potential of coastal aquaculture with shrimp culture being dominant. Brackish-water shrimp is the main species raised along the coast. The enormous increase of the brackish-water aquaculture has some negative impacts as the silting of the inland area as the aquaculture areas are up to 10 km inland and the reduction of the mangrove area. Vietnamese government has put forward the following policies: Using the state capital to invest in scientific research, building centers for aquatic breeding, building human capacity, and establishing stations for environment monitoring and forecast, fishery extension activities, food production and medicine for aquatic animals. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors are significant contributors to Vietnamese economy. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 11 \\nSeafood is always in top 10 of main exporting goods of Vietnam. There are about 7% households in the fishery. Vietnamese fisheries have been growing considerably and promoted by the government, aiming hunger elimination, poverty reduction, and increase of gross domestic product. However, aquatic natural resources are dwindling because of increasing exploitation. Therefore, the development of aquaculture is essential for sustainable economy. In order to develop aquaculture, it is necessary to know water quality, which is suitable for each aquatic species. However, monitoring of coastal water quality using only water samples taken in vast coastal area takes time and cost, besides it is not sufficient because of lack of necessary temporal and spatial information. Therefore, satellite technology with remote sensing technique is used for solving those problems.  \\n Figure 12. Nadir Scan Mode of MicroDragon satellite MicroDragon satellite will take the pictures of Vietnamese ocean areas in several modes including: • Nadir scan mode: As it is illustrated in Figure 12, the satellite will take images at nadir during the period of time flying over the sea of Vietnam. The nadir is the direction pointing directly below a particular location. It is orthogonal to a horizontal flat surface there. The nadir at a given point is the local vertical direction pointing in the direction of the force of gravity at that location. • Tilt scan mode: The satellite will take images in off-nadir direction during the time flying over Vietnamese sea area, as it is shown in Figure 13. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 12 \\n Figure 13.

Coastal Scan Mode of MicroDragon satellite The concept of operations of MicroDragon satellite is as follows: • For primary mission payloads: Operations commands are sent to the satellite to operate the cameras twice a day during daytime. Data downlink can be done automatically and manually. • For secondary mission payloads: Figure 16 describes the conceptual scenario of secondary mission of MicroDragon. The measuring circuits are turned on for 5 minutes once a month. In each time, data will be collected and downlinked.           Figure 16. Conceptual scenario of secondary mission of MicroDragon satellite 1.1.4. Introduction to TableSat TableSat is referred to testing facilities developed for verification of functional and operational design of a satellite. At Tokyo University, the TableSat facilities including the ground segment and the satellite are arranged in two different rooms, as it is illustrated in Figure 17.  \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 14 \\n Figure 17. TableSat layout at Hongo campus, Tokyo University In the satellite room, engineering model (EM) of satellite components are set up on a table, such as X-band Transmitter (XTX), S-band Transponder (STRX), Antenna (ANT), Main Onboard Computer (MOBC), ADCS Onboard Computer (AOBC), Power Control Unit (PCU), Power Distribution Unit (PDU), ADCS sensors, Reaction Wheels (RWs), Magnetic Torquers (MTQs), to name a few. These components may be connected or disconnected depending on purposes of specific functional/ operation tests. Figure 18 is the image of TableSat satellite room at Tokyo University.  \\n Figure 18.

DAS includes an operations computer of which functions are to send command and to display telemetry, and some telemetry analysis computers. Figure 19 is an image of data acquisition system.  \\n Figure 19. TableSat data acquisition system at Tokyo University 1.2. Research Objective For a development of data handling system, especially a new system, it is important to confirm understandings among subsystems in a system but for a new system, it becomes very difficult because it may miss to identify some upper-layers interfaces [28]. Missing of identification of upper-layers interfaces leads to increase of iteration testing processes and development risks.  The objective of the research is to reduce iteration testing processes and development risks by introducing an approach to design of satellite data handling system for architectural-layer-driven verification. The approach clarifies a systematical way of designing process of data handling system, which supports verification of upper-layers data interfaces at low-level testing. The approach helps to reduce development risk and unexpected iteration testing processes, as before these upper-layers interfaces are normally tested based on experience without explicit systematic way.  As it is seen in development V-model of DHS in Figure 20, the development process of data handling system starts from concepts of operations and analysis of system requirements, goes to design of the system, followed by subsystems/ \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 16 \\ncomponents design, and manufacture of hardware. Verification of DHS design can be done through some testing levels including low-level testing and system-level testing. One critical issue of testing DHS is confirmation of upper-layers data interfaces, which cannot easily be done in low-level, is solved in this research. Verification of upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing helps to shorten unexpected iteration testing processes and it also help to confirm understandings among subsystems in early phases which helps to reduce development risks.  \\n  Figure 20. Development V-Model of Data Handling System 1.3. Scope of Research    The research focuses on introducing the approach to satellite data handling system design for architectural-layer-driven verification to reduce iteration testing processes and development risks of data handling system.    The approach clarifies a systematical process of designing and verifying data handling system. However, the approach focuses on new designing process rather than new verification configuration of data handling system, as these configurations have already been stable and saturated in space industry.  For evaluation, the approach is to be applied to design and verify data handling system of a Micro-satellite, and a data relay satellite system. Besides, the evaluation is also done, by interviewing five satellite specialists from different space backgrounds. 1.4.

This chapter starts with proposal of the approach and its originality. Detailed approach is the main content of this chapter. In chapter 4, evaluation of the approach is described in more details. The first way of evaluation is to apply the approach to design and verify data handling system of MicroDragon satellite, and that of a data relay satellite system. The second one is to interview five satellite specialists from different space backgrounds. In final chapter, conclusion and discussion on the research and future work are given.

Model-based development and verification (MDV) 2.1.1.1. Overview of Model-based Development and Verification Environment (MDVE) MDVE [7] has been developed by Astrium company since 2001 with the goal to reduce development time & cost, and to improve systems engineering process in satellite development. The process of developing satellite can be improved based on simulation-based software and hardware environment, which is able to support different development phases from B to E, as it is shown in Figure 21. \\n Figure 21. Satellite development and operation phases defined in MDV [7] To name a few, some functions of MDVE are listed as follows • Early validation of operational design, functional design, and their interfaces. Early validation of ground operations, and electrical ground system equipment (EGSE). These functions allow to early validation of satellite data handling system. • Evaluation of onboard software • Support designing process of satellites Some important elements included in MDVE are shown in Figure 22. • A real-time system simulator, which contains models of the satellite, and its context environment, such as models of satellite subsystems, and models of space \\nSearch for Solutions & Assessment \\nDesign Refinement & Design Validation \\nProduction, Integration & Verification \\nOperation \\n•\\u202fMission Analysis •\\u202fDefinition of alternative System Concepts •\\u202fAssessment & Concept Trade-Off •\\u202fStandardized Documentation \\n•\\u202fEstablishment Validation of Specifications •\\u202fValidation Support w.r.t Operation Behavior, Functional Performance •\\u202fDesign Support w.r.t Interfaces and Budgets \\n•\\u202fEstablishment/ Validation of Test Procedures •\\u202fEGSE Development & Test •\\u202fS/W Verification & Validation •\\u202fS/S, System Test \\n•\\u202fEstablishment/ Validation of Flight Procedures •\\u202fGround Station Validation •\\u202fOperator Training •\\u202fTrouble Shooting Support (FDIR) Phase 0/A Phase B/C Phase C/D Phase E Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 19 \\nenvironment. • An Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) system controls the satellite, and the real-time system simulator.  • Generic Modular Front-end Equipment (GMFE) consists of a set of input/ output (I/O) cards to connect real hardware of satellite components to the real-time satellite simulator. • Software Verification Facility (SVF) for evaluation of onboard software. \\n Figure 22.

MDVE for phase E [7] 2.1.2. “Test like you fly” approach 2.1.2.1. Introduction to “Test like you fly approach” a) Overview “Test like you fly” (TLYF) [25] is an approach that provides a unique assessment \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 22 \\nprocess that focuses on determining the “mission-related” or “like you fly” risks associated with potential flaws in our space systems.  TLYF goes beyond test. This approach contains strategy of acquisition, development of products, definition of requirements, systems engineering, fault analysis, and risk management. As systems engineering methodology often focuses on verifying requirements or confirming that a system meets its requirements, this methodology fails to emphasize test capability, which is necessary to find flaws in an actual system. While TLYF focuses on demonstrating that a mission can be implemented successfully. Procedures of TLYF tests are derived from concept of operations, concepts of mission operations, rather than system requirements. Many systems can successfully meet their stated system requirements but fail to implement the mission. Therefore, TLYF tests are introduced to confirm whether the space and ground systems accomplish the mission. b) Detailed TLYF approach TLYF can cover any of the following methodology, process, tool, and test. • A systems engineering methodology which focuses on validation of mission performance ability of system, rather than verification of system requirements • A process to determine testability of mission concepts, and to identify the risk of untestability: The process is illustrated in Figure 27. “Like you fly” testing is driven by concepts of operations, flight requirements/ constraints, flight rules/ procedures, and users needs. If the mission can be tested, by applying “test like you fly” approach, “like you fly” tests includes identification of test plans, test resources, test procedures, and test configurations. For untestability case, “Test like you fly” exceptions and risks should be accessed. Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 23 \\n          Figure 27. TLYF process to access mission concepts for testability and to access risk [25] • A validation tool of mission performance: TLYF is the approach, focusing on validation of mission performance, instead of that of system requirements.  • A test technique for mission operability at all levels of assembly, as it is described in Figure 28: Operability testing is a good way to discover system flaws, such as data errors, timing issues of software/hardware, memory leaks, to name a few. A mission operability test is different from a single functional and performance test, it concentrates on testing mission performance under specific mission conditions, and timelines. Mission conditions include space environment conditions, such as thermal, radiation, vacuum, micro-gravity environment. Timelines indicate smooth transition from one activity to another, timing interactions between asynchronous activities, to name a few. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 24 \\n       Figure 28. TLYF operability test technique [25] • An operations readiness test, illustrated in Figure 29: The operations readiness test is defined as a total operations chain or end-to-end (space and ground) days-in-the-life/ weeks-in-the-life operability test. End-to-end tests can detect defects that cannot be found in any other tests, such as electrical, functional, and performance tests.  \\n          Figure 29. TLYF total operations chain test [25] In total operations chain test, inputs come from payload and satellite, and outputs are mission products (images, data, to name a few), mission services (for example, communications, navigation). \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 25 \\n Figure 30. Key to injection of “like you fly” tests [25] Key to injection of “like you fly” tests is described in Figure 30 as follows: • Function: is an action or activity related to mission, such as sensing rocket launch, routing communication signals between users, commanding a satellite, etc. • Thread: is either a stimulus or behavior that results from a sequence of system level inputs, and outputs. • Scenario: is a prediction of system uses from a user perspective. • Mission timeline: includes activity order, and timing. • Mission phase: is distinguishable by a discrete change in a key characteristic. 2.1.2.2. Distinction between TLYF and other tests Table 2 describes the difference between TLYF and other tests. Table 2. Distinction between TLYF and other tests Test Features Typical functional, performance, and compatibility testing This is requirements centric test, focusing on verification of requirements.  Environmental testing This includes qualification test of dedicated engineering-model hardware to verify the design, and acceptance test of flight \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 26 \\nhardware to verify workmanship defects. However, demonstrating that hardware survives space environment, is different from showing that the integrated systems/processes work properly. Requirement verification testing Top-level requirements are usually oriented to mission specific performance characteristics, such as resolution, antenna gain, images per pass, bit error rate, data latency, etc. The requirements are usually derived from end-users needs. The system can meet system requirements but it does not guarantee that the system can meet requirements of mission operations where time, timing, order, transition, and environmental interactions, may affect the product or service. All the 3 testing types, mentioned above, are necessary and valuable to find out specific flaws and defects, but not sufficient for validation of mission performance.  Test like you fly This test focuses on mission operations. The lessons show that it is necessary to include “mission operations centric” tests, which demonstrates the capability of mission performance of an integrated system in pre-launch phase [25]. TLYF test may (not must) cover any of 3 fore-mentioned testing types. 2.1.3. Orbital Sciences spacecraft integration and test suite based on “test as you fly” approach With the evolution of geo communications product, Orbital Sciences has had an opportunity to develop, evolve and enhance its spacecraft integration and test suite that used operator-driven manual commanding to repeatable, automated test sequences executed with minimal operator intervention based on “test like you fly” approach. These enhanced procedures have been implemented in such a way that the same core test suite can be used across multiple spacecraft builds with a minimum of changes from one program to the next [3]. The goal is to solve three test problems of geostationary telecommunications satellite as follows: • Validation of command through accessing telemetry • Improved testing setup to simplify execution, repeatability and analysis of attitude control system operational tests Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 27 \\n• Implementation of an automated method to simplify spacecraft unique heater and thermistor testing  The principle of the test is that verification of basic hardware functions is done, by accessing telemetry responses of relevant hardware commands. At system level, 50% of discrepancies are shared by 25% of operator error, and 24% of design error. A repeatable, automated test suite can significantly reduce the portion of discrepancies due to operator error [3]. Up to 2007, spacecraft integration and test suite in Orbital Sciences had successfully tested, launched, and verified in-orbit ten commercial geostationary telecommunications satellites such as Indostar-1, BSAT-2a, BSAT-2b, BSAT-2c, Star-2, to name a few [3]. “Test as you fly” approach is performed via an operational ground control station. All test actions are initiated by flight commands, and responses are validated by flight telemetry. To provide repeatable testing, test scripts have been developed in Spacecraft Test Operations Language. 2.1.3.1. Telemetry access for command validation One persistent problem of satellite command validation is location and frequency of the telemetry data [3]. Many telemetry points, which are used for diagnosing hardware or flight software errors, are not always necessary during normal operations. Therefore, they should be collected less frequently that critical telemetry points.  In any selected modes, all the required telemetry should be available in a format. However, during satellite testing, a specific telemetry required for command validation may be not available in active formats. If test operator does not know where to find the telemetry, telemetry access will become more difficult. Orbital Sciences has developed “Telemetry Point Retrieval Logic” algorithm to solve this problem.  The algorithm is described in Figure 31 as follows. The telemetry locations are identified by bit map variables attached to the telemetry point names. When a telemetry point is requested, the bit map will detect whether the point is available in either of two active formats. If so, returning the point to the operator. If not, scanning the bit map to find the format, which includes the point, and the system command format change on stream 2, followed by commanding the stream 2 back to original format after retrieving the requested point.

Improved setup to simplify execution, repeatability and analysis of attitude control system operational tests Because of complexity of Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), and its dynamic properties, ADCS testing results cannot be repeatable. Besides, some of results need to be post-processed to evaluate test success or test failure. To solve those issues, several changes have been applied to testing configuration of ADCS as follows: • Changes of ADSC flight software: Introduction of commands, used for setting parameters in the test environment, supports a better control over ADCS onboard software.  • Improvement of repeatability of the tests by re-making the test scripts: Test scripts have been re-worked to perform additional operations. This reduces overall test duration by reducing necessary intervention of operators. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 29 \\n2.1.3.3. Implementation of an automated method to simplify spacecraft unique heater and thermistor testing from one spacecraft to the next Thermal Control System (TCS) health check provides necessary validation tests of functionality of all the heaters and thermistors on the satellite. Typical TCS test sequence is in Figure 32. All the parameters required to test heaters are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

Thermal Control System Health Test Sequence [3] 2.1.4. Best practices for verification, validation, and test in model-based design The paper [22] focuses on using model-based design in verification, validation of on board software. As the size and complexity of the embedded software programs grow, using traditional development tools such as editors, compilers, and debuggers, is not suitable anymore, thus, is substituted by models. The models can be used • As executable specifications • To define system/subsystem requirements, and related interfaces • To visualize virtual prototypes, and complete system • To automatically generate codes of onboard software algorithms 2.1.4.1. Developing model tests with the design One advantage of model-based design is using models to perform verification, validation, and test. It means that test suites can be applied to the models, and the test suites can be used to test the onboard software implementation. The entire test suite can \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 31 \\nbe used repeatedly for onboard software testing. This process is called model-in-the-loop-simulation (MILS). After that, the same MILS are implemented again on the host development environment to make the software-in-the-loop-simulation (SILS). To test the compatibility of onboard software and hardware, the software can be embedded in targeted processor after compiling. The co-simulation step is called processor-in-the-loop-simulation (PILS) or hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (HILS). All these processes are illustrated in Figure 33.  \\n Figure 33. Test suites running against MIL, SIL, and PIL [22] 2.1.4.2. Testing exhaustively in simulation  Most engineers believe more in results of hardware testing, however the hardware testing may be too costly since if some hardware elements do not work properly, the prototypes will be damaged or destroyed. While with testing in a model environment, many different test cases can be run faster, besides it also can help to reduce the number of critical tests, which must be done with hardware in real time. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 32 \\n2.1.4.3. Running the same tests in simulation and in the lab To run the same tests in simulation and in the lab, it is necessary to have a facility, which supports hardware connectivity, measures physical quantities, and link to the modeling environment. The same testing contexts have to be used in order to analyze hardware and simulation test results. Hardware-in-the-loop testing should be done before the availability of manufactured hardware. It is used to test production electronic control units (ECUs) and to test prototype control algorithms. Integration testing: Model-based design can be used to make continuous testing and validation process. This process begins from testing of the lowest level hardware (component) to testing of the complete system. It helps to detect defects in the interface among components, subsystems in early phases. 2.2. Discussion and conclusion on the existing approaches All the reviewed approaches have shown their advantages of testing data handling system. MDVE focuses on verification of design while “test like you fly” focuses on verification of mission performance. However, for development of a new system, mutual understanding among subsystems/ systems is very critical, thus, it should be confirmed as early as possible. The more interfaces are confirmed in early phases, the more development risks and failures can be reduced. All the fore-mentioned approaches miss to clarify a systematical process to design and verify a system in such a way that upper-layers interfaces of system of interest, data handling system in this research, can be verified at low-level testing.  MDVE [7] focuses on development and verification environment, testing facilities are built to support development of satellite system. MDVE supports development but it cannot show designing and verifying processes of a system. “Test like you fly” approach [25] target at validation of mission performance in space environment, rather than at verification of system performance. Orbital Sciences test suite [3] supports validation of command, attitude determination and control subsystem tests, and thermal control subsystem tests, rather than systematical designing and testing processes of a system. Model-based design for verification, validation, and test approach [22] support evaluation of onboard software, focuses on testing processes during development phases. Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 33 \\nThis approach is very suitable for development of attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) where ADCS algorithms need to be tested before being applied to flight software. However, it is not suitable for development of data handling system, which consists of hardware, onboard software, and all data handling processes existing in the satellite and ground segment. In conclusion, a systematical approach to design and verify satellite data handling system is necessary. In the next chapter, this approach is to be introduced. The designing and verifying processes of data handling system are explained in detail. The goal of the approach is to reduce development risks of increasing development time and cost by shortening unexpected iteration designing and testing processes. The iteration processes can be reduced, by verifying upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing.

Introduction to the approach to satellite data handling system design for architectural-layer-driven verification 3.1.1. Goal of the approach The goal of the approach is to reduce development risks and shorten unexpected iteration testing processes. To achieve the goal, two types of architecture are to be introduced, and called as “horizontal” architecture and “vertical” architecture. “Vertical” architecture supports description of upper-layers interfaces, which cannot be done in horizontal architecture. Horizontal architecture is designed in operational domain and systems domain, including operational design, functional design, and physical design. Vertical architecture is designed with multiple layer view (vertical view), showing virtual system interfaces in some upper layers in open system interconnection model. In case of data handling system, more data interfaces are added to horizontal architecture by vertical architecture. Since more interfaces can be identified in the architecture, they can be verified at low-level testing before system-level testing, as it is illustrated in Figure 20. This helps to shorten development iteration process, and reduce development risks by confirming upper-layers interfaces in early phases. 3.1.2. Detailed approach  The approach consists of two parts including design (left side of V-model) and verification (right side of V-model) as in Figure 34. 3.1.2.1. Design of data handling system a) Design of horizontal architecture of data handling system Horizontal architecture is called in order to distinguish it from vertical architecture, which will be described later. Two types of architecture are designed from different viewpoints. Horizontal architecture of satellite data handling system is designed based on Department of Defense Architecture Framework 1.0 (DoDAF1.0) using operational view and systems view in 2 domains including operational architecture domain, system architecture domain. Operational View (OV) and Systems View (SV) of DoDAF1.0 Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 35 \\nsupport design of operational activities, functionality and physical system of satellite data handling system, and identification of relationship among them.  \\n Figure 34. Introduction to the approach to satellite data handling system design for architectural-layer-driven verification \\n Figure 35. Basis of the approach Operational activities affect the way that data handling system performs, thus, giving some insights of data interfaces between the satellite and the ground segment.

Basis of the approach is that 3D-image of architecture of a system can be built by looking from horizontal view to obtain horizontal architecture, and from vertical view to obtain vertical architecture Figure 35. The relationship between operational domain and functional domain is shown in Figure 36. The horizontal architecture consists of operational design, functional design, and physical design in operational architecture domain, and systems architecture domain. In operational domain, operational activities are given based on concept of operations and capability of the system. These activities are performed and assigned to specific operational nodes, which are a part of horizontal architecture. Operational activities and operation nodes are implemented by functions and systems present in systems architecture domain. The systems are designed to perform the functions that are built from system requirements.   \\n Figure 36. Relationship between operation architecture domain and systems architecture domain b) Design of vertical architecture of data handling system In this research, one new type of architecture is introduced, called “vertical” architecture. The vertical architecture is designed based on open system interconnection (OSI) model which is illustrated in Figure 37, in order to identify more interfaces in \\nHorizontal architecture \\nOperational node \\nSystem \\nOperational activity \\nFunction \\nCapability \\nRequirements \\nImplemented  by \\nImplemented  by Performs  Performs  Basis of  Basis of  Specified  by  Specified  by  Composed of  Composed of  \\nOperational architecture domain Systems architecture domain (DoDAF - OV) (DoDAF - SV) Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 37 \\naddition to those which are described in the horizontal architecture. The purpose of designing vertical architecture is to introduce more upper-layers data interfaces in system architecture which allows to verify those interfaces at low-level testing, instead of waiting until system-level test. The way of design and test helps to shorten unexpected iteration development processes of data handling system, and leads to reduce development risks of increasing development cost and time. Three layers of interfaces are considered in data handling system as in Figure 38, including physical layer, data link layer, and application layer. Data is transmitted between the satellite and the ground segment through antennas system. To handle data, there are some onboard computers in the satellite and a mission control center on the ground. The satellite onboard computers are used to implement ADCS software which processes TLM collected from ADCS components (gyro, star tracker, sun sensor, reaction wheel, magnetic torque, etc.) by utilizing ADCS algorithms, and to implement C&DH software which manage and control all the tasks, processes occurred in the satellite, as well as implementing mission data processing software which processes raw mission data received from mission instruments. To encode & decode the data, CCSDS (the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) transport services in the satellite and the ground segment are necessary. These services apply CCSDS standards & protocols to create data frames and data packets. The CCSDS services embedded in the satellite and ground segment must be compatible with each other. The following is description of 3 layers introduced in vertical architecture. \\n Figure 37. Open System Interconnection Model Layer 1 (Physical layer): The physical layer defines data link between satellite \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 38 \\nantennas and ground antennas. The physical layer has the following major functions: • This layer defines electrical and physical specifications of data connection, and identifies relationship among antennas and radio frequency. • This layer is responsible for transmission and reception of raw data using radio frequency. • This layer defines transmission mode, such as, simplex, half duplex, full duplex, to name a few. • This layer defines network topology, such as bus, mesh, ring, etc. In satellite data handling system, physical layer represents radio frequency (RF) link, which carries transmission data, between the satellite antennas and ground station antennas. Types of these antennas are used based on operational frequencies of electromagnetic wave carrier. \\n Figure 38. An example of vertical architecture of a satellite data handling system Layer 2 (Data link layer): The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer (link) between two connected devices in space and on ground. It can also detect and possibly correct may-occur errors in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two devices, and defines the protocol for flow control between them. In DHS, the data link layer describes the interface between 2 CCSDS transport \\nData Handling  H/W \\nAttitude Control H/W \\nPower Supply & Thermal Control  H/W \\nCOM H/W \\nGround Station H/W \\nMission Control  H/W \\nRadio Frequency TLM/CMD TLM/CMD Packets \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nData Handling  Application S/W \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nMission Control Application  S/W \\nMission Control  S/W Data Handling S/W H/W: Hardware S/W: Software  \\nApplication Layer Data Link Layer Physical Layer \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 39 \\nservices in the satellite and the ground segment. The interface contains TLM/ CMD packet information. Layer 3 (Application layer): The application layer is the layer close to the end user, in other words, the application layer and the user interact directly with onboard software which is embedded in onboard computer. The application layer functions typically include identification of communication partners, determination of resource availability, and synchronization of communication. This layer supports application and end-user processes.  Application layer of satellite data handling system represents interfaces between the satellite and the mission control center, from the sources of data in onboard software to the application ground station software where data are analyzed, displayed, and processed. 3.2.1.2. Verification of data handling system Verification testing configuration is built based on interfaces identified in horizontal architecture, and vertical architecture design. The introduction of a new vertical design in the approach allows to verify upper-layers data interfaces at low-level testing, thus, reducing development risks of increasing development cost and time, as unexpected iteration development iteration processes are shortened. The verification of data handling system consists of verification of TLM/ CMD, verification of mission data, and verification of radio frequency link. Each kind of configuration is described in more detail as bellows. \\n Figure 39.

The data are processed, encrypted, header-attached, and packed, then sent to operations computers that embed ground CCSDS transport service. In the ground segment, the data packets are decrypted, interpreted, processed, and displayed in display computer. It is a similar case for command, which are sent from operations computer to the onboard computer.  Verification of telemetry/ command can be done with a simple testing configuration as in Figure 39. Verification of mission data: It is the same case with verification of telemetry/ command, the only difference lies at that the mission data go to science data handling unit instead of onboard computer. The verification of mission data is illustrated in Figure 40. \\n Figure 40. Verification of Mission Data Verification of physical layer (radio frequency): Radio frequency layer can be verified by 2 ways. The first way is done, by connecting onboard computer of the satellite and operations computer by coaxial cable, as it is illustrated in Figure 41. In the second way, verification of radio frequency is done in end-to-end test.  \\nScience Data Handling Unit \\nOther subsystem simulators  PC \\nOperations PC \\nMission Data Mission Data Packet Packets \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nMission Data Application S/W \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nData Monitor  S/W \\nOperations Software Science Data Handling S/W \\nSpace Environment Simulator \\nOther Subsystem Simulators Simulators Software \\nCables (Physical Layer) Cables Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 41 \\n Figure 41. Verification of RF link by coaxial cable connection Coaxial cable is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Coaxial cable differs from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line [26]. Coaxial cable is used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals. One advantage of coaxial over other types of radio transmission line is that in an ideal coaxial cable the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer conductors. Coaxial cable can protect the signal from external electromagnetic interference. \\n Figure 42.

Introduction to Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) The Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DoDAF), version 1.0, was published in 2004. It defines a common approach for DoD architecture description development, presentation, and integration for both war-fighting operations and business operations and processes. The Framework is intended to ensure that architecture descriptions can be compared and related across organizational boundaries, including joint and multinational boundaries [24].  An architecture description is a representation of a defined domain, as of a current or future point in time, in terms of its constituent parts, what those parts do, how the parts relate to each other and to the environment, and the rules and constraints governing them. Within the DoDAF, architectures are described in terms of three views: Operational View (OV), Systems View (SV), and Technical Standards View (TV). An architecture description is composed of architecture products that are interrelated within each view and are interrelated across views. Architecture products are those graphical, textual, and tabular items that are developed in the course of gathering architecture data, identifying their composition into related architecture components or composites, and modeling the relationships among those composites to describe characteristics pertinent to the architecture’s intended use [24].  The term architecture is generally used both to refer to an architecture description and an architecture implementation. An architecture description is a representation of a current or postulated real-world configuration of resources, rules, and relationships [24].  In this research, some of operational view and systems view are selected to design horizontal architecture of satellite data handling system in operational domain, functional domain, and physical domain. The following is a brief description of those selected view. 3.1.3.1. Operational view An Operational View describes the tasks and activities, operational elements, and information exchanges required to conduct operations. A pure OV does not depend on materiel and technology. However, operations and their relationships may be influenced by new technologies such as collaboration technology, where process improvements are in practice before policy can reflect the new procedures. Three of operational view including OV-1, OV-2, and OV-5 are selected to design operational activities of Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 43 \\nsatellite data handling system. Table 4 describes operational view in DoDAF.  a) OV-1 (High-level operational concept graphic) The High-Level Operational Concept Graphic describes a mission and highlights main operational nodes that will be defined later, and interesting or unique aspects of operations. It provides a description of the interactions between the subject architecture and its environment, and between the architecture and external systems. A textual description accompanying the graphic is crucial as graphics alone are not sufficient for capturing the necessary architecture data [24].  Purpose of OV-1 is to provide a quick, high-level description of what the architecture is supposed to do, and how it is supposed to do it.  Detailed Description: OV-1 consists of a graphical executive summary for a given architecture with accompanying text. The product identifies the mission/domain covered in the architecture and the viewpoint reflected in the architecture. OV-1 should convey what the architecture is about and an idea of the players and operations involved.  Table 4. Operational view in DoDAF 1.0 [24] \\n b) OV-2 (Operational node connectivity description) The Operational Node Connectivity Description graphically depicts the operational nodes with needlines between those nodes that indicate a need to exchange information. The graphic includes internal operational nodes as well as external nodes [24].  Purpose of OV-2 is intended to track the need to exchange information from \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 44 \\nspecific operational nodes to others.  Detailed Description: The main features of this product are the operational nodes and the needlines between them that indicate a need to exchange information. The product indicates the key players and the interactions necessary to conduct the corresponding operational activities of OV-5.  Operational Nodes: An operational node is an element of the operational architecture that produces, consumes, or processes information.  Needlines: A needline documents the requirement to exchange information between nodes. The needline does not indicate how the information transfer is implemented. Needlines are represented by arrows, and arrows on the diagram represent needlines only.  OV-2 should also illustrate needs to exchange information between operational nodes and external nodes.   Operational Activities: The operational activities performed by a given node may be listed on the graphic, if space permits.  c) OV-5 (Operational activity model) The Operational Activity Model describes the operations that are normally conducted in the course of achieving a mission or a business goal. It describes capabilities, operational activities (or tasks), input and output (I/O) flows between activities, and I/O flows to/from activities that are outside of the scope of the architecture [24].  Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 45 \\n Figure 43. Operational activity hierarchy chart and operation activity diagram [24]  Purposes of OV-5 are to • Clearly delineate lines of responsibility for activities when coupled with OV-2   • Uncover unnecessary operational activity redundancy   • Make decisions about streamlining, combining, or omitting activities   • Define or flag issues, opportunities, or operational activities and their interactions (information flows among the activities) that need to be scrutinized further   • Provide a necessary foundation for depicting activity sequencing and timing in OV-6a, OV-6b, and OV-6c    Detailed Description: OV-5 describes capabilities, operational activities (or tasks), I/O flows between activities, and I/O flows to/from activities that are outside the scope of the architecture.   OV-5 graphic may include a hierarchy chart of the activities, which is described in Figure 43. A hierarchy chart helps provide an overall picture of the activities involved and a quick reference for navigating the OV-5 I/O flow model.  3.1.3.2. Systems view The Systems View is a set of graphical and textual products that describe systems and interconnections providing for, or supporting, DoD functions. SV products focus on specific physical systems with specific physical (geographical) locations. The \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 46 \\nrelationship between architecture data elements across the SV to the Operational View (OV) can be exemplified, as systems are procured and fielded to support organizations and their operations [24]. All the systems views are shown in Table 5. Physical and functional design of architecture of satellite data handling system are done based on some systems views appropriately selected from table 3 including SV-1, SV-4, and SV-5. a) SV-1 (Systems interface description) SV-1 describes nodes and the systems geographical location of these nodes to support organizations/human roles represented by operational nodes defined in OV-2. SV-1 also identifies the interfaces among systems and systems nodes.  Purpose of SV-1: Identification of systems nodes and systems that support operational nodes.  Detailed Description: SV-1 connects OV and SV by depicting the assignments of systems and systems nodes to the operational nodes. OV-2 represents the operational nodes, while SV-1 represents the systems nodes and localization of systems in systems nodes. In addition, SV-1 addresses system interfaces. An interface represents one or more communications paths among systems nodes or among systems. b) SV-4 (Systems functionality description) SV-4 depicts system functions and system functional hierarchies, and the system data flows among them.  Purpose of SV-4: including (i) development of a clear description of the necessary system data flows between input and output respectively consumed and produced by each subsystem, (ii) Assurance of completeness of the functional connectivity, and (iii) Assurance of appropriate level of detail of the functional decomposition. Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 47 \\nTable 5. Systems view in DoDAF 1.0 [24] \\n Detailed Description: SV-4 describes system functions and the flow of system data among system functions. SV-4 may focus on intra-nodal system data flow, inter-nodal system data flow, system data flow without node considerations, function to system allocations, and function to node allocations.  SV-4 may have both a hierarchy (decomposition model) shown in Figure 44 and a system data flow model shown in Figure 45. The hierarchy model represents a functional decomposition.  c) SV-5 (Operational activity to systems function traceability matrix): The matrix has one template as described in Figure 46. Operational Activity to Systems Function Traceability Matrix is a specification of the relationships between the set of operational activities applicable to architecture, and the set of system functions applicable to that architecture [24].  \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 48 \\n Figure 44. Decomposition model of systems functionality description (SV-4) \\n Figure 45. System data flow model of systems functionality description (SV-4) Purpose of SV-5: representation of the mapping of operational activities to system functions. Extended SV-5 can also depict mapping of capabilities to operational activities, operational activities to system functions, system functions to systems.  Detailed Description: The term of OV and SV are used for activities and functions of which tasks are to be perform, to accept inputs, and to develop outputs. The distinction is created by the fact that system functions are executed by automated systems, while operational activities describe business operations that may be conducted by humans, automated systems, or both.  \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 49 \\n Figure 46. Operational activity to systems function traceability matrix (SV-5) 3.2. Originality of the approach This research is introducing an approach to satellite data handling system design for architectural-layer-driven verification. The approach in this research is developed to accomplish the goal of reducing development risks and unexpected iteration testing processes. The development risks and iteration testing processes can be reduced, by confirming upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing, instead of system-level testing, as it is described in Figure 20. Verification of upper-layers interfaces can be done via architecture design process, which outputs horizontal architecture and vertical architecture. While before, upper-layers interfaces was identified and verified based on experience of development engineers without any explicit systematic approaches. The following points clarify the originality of the research compared to previous ones. • Addition of vertical view to design vertical architecture: Before in previous approaches, architecture is designed based on operational, functional & physical \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 50 \\nproperties of a system as horizontal architecture in the proposed approach, and vertical architecture was not defined. The proposed approach supports in building architecture from horizontal view and additional vertical view, which allows to built 3D-image of architecture. • The proposed approach offers a systematic classification of system architecture into vertical architecture and horizontal architecture. In space industry, before experienced engineers identified and tested upper-layers interfaces based on their experiences without any explicit way. With this approach, satellite development engineers can fully define and test data handling system in systematic way. The systematic way of designing and testing data handling system shows a great advantage when applying to a complex system, such as a data relay satellite system where more than two satellites, and more than two ground segments, connect to each other to share data. The data relay satellite system is illustrated in Figure 47.  • The vertical architecture in the proposed approach supports in identifying missed upper-layer interfaces, which could only be defined by experienced engineers based on their experiences.  \\n Figure 47.

The validation is to be done by confirming with satellite specialists whether the approach achieves the objective of the research. 4.1.1. Applying the approach to develop DHS of MicroDragon satellite The approach is applied to design architecture and verify data handling system of MicroDragon satellite. The output includes horizontal and vertical architecture of DHS, together with test results obtained from TableSat activities at Tokyo University. The designing and verifying processes of data handling system of MicroDragon satellite is described in detail in the next chapter. 4.1.2. Applying the approach to develop DHS of a data relay satellite system  The data relay satellite system, introduced in this thesis, consists of a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite, and a geostationary (GEO) satellite, together with their ground segments. The system is illustrated in Figure 47. The approach is applied to this system in order to emphasize the advantage of this approach in term of designing and verifying data handling system of a complex satellite system.  In this thesis, detailed designing process is not shown, only results and testing configuration of data handling system of the data delay satellite system are to be described. 4.1.3.

Architecture design of DHS of MicroDragon satellite Architecture of DHS of MicroDragon satellite consists of horizontal and vertical architecture. The horizontal architecture describes operations, functionality, and physical design of DHS of MicroDragon satellite, where interfaces/ links in the system are represented. The vertical architecture adds some upper-layers data interfaces.  4.2.1.1. Horizontal architecture design of DHS of MicroDragon satellite The horizontal architecture is built in operational architecture domain and systems architecture domain, based on operational view OV-1 à\\uf0e0 OV-5 à\\uf0e0 OV-2, and systems view SV-4 à\\uf0e0 SV-5 à\\uf0e0 SV-1 of DoDAF. a) Operational view OV-1 describes high-level concept of operations (ConOPs) of MicroDragon, as it is shown in Figure 48. The mission of MicroDragon (MDG) satellite is to observe color of the water in Vietnamese sea areas in order to access water quality and locate aquatic creatures.  \\n Figure 48. Concept of operations of MicroDragon satellite The satellite has 4 cameras, when it passes over the targeted areas, it will take the pictures and store the image data in onboard computer (OBC). This process can be automatically controlled by software programs, embedded in OBC, or manually controlled by uplink command from the ground station. The ground segment located in \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 58 \\nHanoi of MDG satellite includes a mission control center, one X-band antenna to receive mission data, and one S-band antenna to send/receive CMD/TLM respectively. Every time when the satellite passes over its ground station, it will downlink the data including housekeeping (TLM) and mission data, and followed by processing and storing of data in the ground segment. The data downlink process can also be implemented automatically by the software, or manually by sending uplink command from the ground station. OV-5 (Operational activities of DHS of MDG satellite): Operational activities are defined as tasks and assignments which can normally be performed by human or machines. Based on concept of operations described in OV-1, the operational activities of DHS of MDG satellite are divided into activities in three phases including initial operations, nominal operations, and end-of-operations. Figure 49 describes broken down structure of operational activities. Figure 50 shows the flow of operational activities. Then those three activities are to be broken down to lower levels in such a way that it is able to localize each operational activity to a specific operational node, and specific functions of DHS. \\n Figure 49. High-level operational activities of DHS of MicroDragon satellite The initial operations includes activities of the satellite and the ground station in initial phase after the satellite separates from the rocket, and before the satellite goes to nominal operations or reaches to safe & stable state to perform the mission. There are some conditions to determine whether the satellite exits initial operations to nominal operations, such as success of deployment of solar array paddle, voltage of battery is bigger than requirements, or implementation of an uplink command to switch de-tumbling mode to another mode. After exiting the initial phase, the satellite enters nominal operations when the satellite can perform the mission. Some operations modes are considered in this phase, \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 59 \\nincluding spin sun acquisition mode where satellite attitude is controlled by magnetic torque, 3-axis sun acquisition mode where satellite attitude is controlled by reaction wheels, coarse earth acquisition mode where the satellite can downlink store & forward data, fine earth acquisition mode where the satellite can perform store & forward mission, and fine pointing earth where the satellite can capture pictures and downlink data. If the satellite wants to end its lifecycle, it has to deorbit by falling off to the ground. In order to protect human and environment, the satellite has to be able to burn itself under effect of friction with the earth atmosphere. The position where the satellite may land on the earth should also be carefully calculated. Normally, satellite operators try to control the satellite to fall off in the ocean when it deorbits.  \\n Figure 50. High-level operational activities flow of DHS of MicroDragon satellite In initial operations, broken down structure and flow of operational activities are shown in Figure 51 and Figure 52. Communications at the ground station must be in readiness state, even before the separation, as it is necessary to check the health of the satellite by observing first telemetries received from the satellite, and to send first commands to operate the satellite. Initial operations phase is very critical, as it determines whether the satellite has any survival chances in space after seperation from the rocket. As soon as the satellite is separated from the rocket, some important components are activated to maintain minimal operations, including onboard computer (OBC) to control and manage all the activities, power control unit (PCU) to supply the power, and S-band transponder (STRX) to send/receive TLM/CMD.  The command is generated from the mission control center, and sent to the satellite via the ground station S-band antenna and the satellite S-band antenna. This command is then sent to onboard computer to be processed and distributed to relevant satellite \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 60 \\ncomponents. After receiving the command, these components will perform their dedicated tasks and functions such as turn on/ off, capture the pictures, etc. The telemetry is collected from satellite components frequently, and sent to onboard computer. The frequency of collecting the data depends on operations control and management algorithms of C&DH software, and ADCS software, for example, telemetry can be collected and updated one time per second. \\n Figure 51. Operational activities in initial operations of DHS of MicroDragon satellite (A1)  Figure 52 shows the sequence of operational activities in initial operations of data handling system of MicroDragon satellite. At first, communication part in the ground segment should be started up (A1.1), even before the satellite separates from the rocket. This condition guarantees that the satellite can communicate with the ground station at any moments after seperation. To maintain minimal operations, some satellite components should be turned on as soon as the separation (A1.2), for example onboard computer to control and manage all the processes, S-band transponder (STRX) to transmit and receive data, and power control unit (PCU) to supply electrical power. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 61 \\n Figure 52. A1 operational activities flow of DHS of MicroDragon satellite  Processing telemetry and command (A1.3) is one of most important tasks of data handling system. It provides smooth operations between the satellite and the ground segment. With telemetry received from the satellite, the mission control center can check health status of the satellite and each satellite component, as well as the information of orbit and attitude of the satellite, etc. The cycle of processing TLM/ CMD can be defined from collection, storage and package of data by onboard computer (A1.3.1) à\\uf0e0 sending TLM package by satellite S-band antenna (A1.3.2) à\\uf0e0 transmission of TLM package by ground station S-band antenna (A1.3.3) à\\uf0e0 reception, storage and analysis of TLM by mission control center (A1.3.4) à\\uf0e0 generation of CMD by mission control center (A1.3.5) à\\uf0e0 transmission of CMD by the ground station S-band antenna (A1.3.6) à\\uf0e0 receiving CMD by satellite S-band antenna (A1.3.7) à\\uf0e0 processing and distributing CMD to relevant satellite components by onboard computer (A1.3.8).  In initial phase, the satellite is under fragile state, thus, failures detection and recovery (A1.4 & A1.5) are essential. For those severe failures, it is necessary to detect and recover as soon as possible by the software programs embedded in OBC. The other failures can be detected by analyzing relevant telemetries, and fixed by appropriate uplink commands. In case of occurrence of failures, detection, analysis and recovery should be done before doing any other tasks. In nominal phase, Figure 53 and Figure 54 describe broken down structure and flow of operational activities. Communication in the ground segment can be activated or \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 62 \\ndeactivated depending on whether the ground station wants to communicate with the satellite (A2.1).

MDG satellite has to implement deorbit by falling off to the ground. The deorbit command (A3.1) can be set automatically in such a way that the time of deorbit is set in the onboard software embedded in OBC (A3.1.1), or be set manually by uplink command from the ground (A3.1.2). To prepare for deorbit (A3.2), it is necessary to check status and position of the satellite to guarantee that the satellite will fall off to a region where there is no or minimal damage to human and environment. Before deorbiting (A3.2.2), all the satellite components have to be turned off to avoid unexpected problems, which may happen during and after deorbiting (A3.2.1) After successfully deorbit, identification of position of status of orbiting should be made to collect the debris (A3.3). Finally, the satellite owner should make a report/ announcement on orbiting status of the satellite.  \\n Figure 56. A3 operational activities flow of DHS of MicroDragon satellite OV-2 (Operational node connectivity): Operational node is an element of the operational architecture that produces, consumes, or processes information [24]. An operation node can represent an operational/ human role, an organization or organization type, etc. DHS of MicroDragon satellite consists of three nodes including node A (MicroDragon satellite), node B (ground station), and node C (mission control center, MCC), as shown in Figure 57. Besides, there is an external source and destination, which is the end-users (or scientists) who needs the data for their researches. Those nodes are connected via needlines. A needline documents the requirement to exchange information between nodes. Data going through a needline are also specified. Data from node A to node B, and from node B to node C contain telemetry and \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 65 \\ncommand.

The ground station (node B) implement some operational activities including transmitting TLM in initial phase (A1.3.3); transmitting CMD in initial phase (A1.3.6); transmitting CMD in nominal phase (A2.2.2); transmitting TLM in nominal phase (A2.2.3); and transmitting mission data in nominal phase (A2.4.4). The operational activities assigned to the mission control center (node C) are composed of starting satellite-tracking antenna system in initial phase (A1.1.1); starting up the mission control center in initial phase (A1.1.2); receiving, storing and analyzing TLM in initial phase (A1.3.4); generating CMD in initial phase (A1.3.5); manually detecting and analyzing failures in initial phase (A1.5.2); activating/ deactivating the satellite-tracking antenna system in nominal phase (A2.1.1); activating/ deactivating the mission control center in nominal phase (A2.1.2); generating CMD in nominal phase (A2.2.1); receiving, storing and analyzing TLM in nominal phase (A2.3.4); receiving, storing and processing mission data in nominal phase (A2.4.5); manually detecting and analyzing failures in nominal phase (A2.5.2); manually recovery from failures in nominal phase (A2.6.2); manually set end-of-operations CMD (A3.1.2); manually turning off all the satellite components (A3.2.1); checking satellite deorbiting status and position (A3.3); and reporting satellite deorbiting status (A3.4). b) Systems view SV-4 (Systems functionality description): The systems functionality description documents system functional hierarchies and system functions, and the system data flows between them [24]. Applying system design approach to make functional design and physical design of DHS of MicroDragon satellite. In each phase of operations, Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 67 \\nfunction requirements can be obtained by using context diagram and use case diagram. As mentioned in OV section, there are three phases of operations of DHS of MicroDragon satellite which are initial operations, nominal operations, and end-of-operations. In initial operations phase: Context diagram defines the boundary between the systems, or parts of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it. DHS (System of Interest, SoI) consists of the satellite, X-band antenna, S-band antenna, and the mission control center. The SoI interacts with space environment as it receives space condition, such as temperature, solar radiation, micro-gravity effect, sunlight from the space. The operators lie outside of the boundary of the SoI, operate the satellite. The context diagram in initial phase is shown in Figure 59. In initial operations phase, only telemetry and command are transmitted via DHS.  The system of interest (DHS) consists of the satellite, the ground station and the mission control center. The satellite sends/receives telemetry/command to/from the mission control center, via the ground station. \\n Figure 59. Context diagram of DHS of MicroDragon in initial operations phase The use case diagram, shown in Figure 60, represents the user’s interaction with the system. The diagram shows the relationship between the users and different use cases in which the user is involved. \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 68 \\nSpace environment provides heat for the satellite. The heat from the sun may cause temperature inside the satellite to increase beyond operational temperature ranges of satellite components, thus, damaging the components. Therefore, it is necessary to have temperature control inside the satellite to maintain temperature inside the satellite in allowable ranges. Besides, the sun also provides sunlight, which contains a big energy. The satellite can use it to maintain its operations in space by transforming solar energy into electric energy. In addition, the satellite must have ability to receive command and transmit telemetry from/ to the mission control center. The ground station consisting of antennas system is used to transmit telemetry and command back and forth between the satellite and the mission control center, as in initial operations, there is no mission data.  In the mission control center (MCC), the operators are involved in generating and sending command, as well as receiving, storing and analyzing telemetry. The mission control center receive/ send TLM/ CMD from/to the satellite via the ground station. \\n Figure 60. Use case diagram of DHS in initial operations phase of MicroDragon satellite Functional requirements can be obtained from context diagram and use case diagram as in Figure 61. Each operational node is assigned to specific high-level functions. The high-level \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 69 \\nfunctions are then broken down to low-level ones in such a way that it is possible to allocate these low-level functions to one specific subsystem/ components inside each node. \\n Figure 61. Functional requirements of DHS in initial operations phase of MicroDragon satellite The satellite (node A), in initial phase, performs some functions including controlling temperature (F1.1), supplying power by itself (F1.2), receiving and processing CMD (F1.3), collecting and sending TLM (F1.4), detecting and recovering failures (F1.5), and protecting the satellite from space environment (F1.6). Control-temperature function (F1.1) can be broken down to low-level functions, such as, measuring temperature (F1.1.1), heating up function (F1.1.2), creating thermal radiation inside the satellite (F1.1.3), and creating thermal insulation from space environment (F1.1.4). To have the ability to supply power by itself (F1.2), the satellite should be able to receive sunlight (F1.2.1), transform solar energy to electric energy (F1.2.2), store electricity power (F1.2.3), control electricity power (F1.2.4), distribute electricity power to satellite components (F1.2.5), and automatically turn on power supply right after separation (F1.2.6). To receive and process CMD sent from the ground station (F1.3), the satellite has to have receiving CMD function (F1.3.1), interpreting CMD function (F1.3.2), and distributing CMD function (F1.3.3). For collecting and sending TLM (F1.4), some functions should be included in the satellite, such as, collecting TLM \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 70 \\nfunctions (F1.4.1), storing TLM function (F1.4.2), packaging TLM function (F1.4.3), and transmitting TLM function (F1.4.4). The function of detection and recovery from failures (F1.5) can be broken down into automatically detecting failures function (F1.5.1), and automatically recovering from failures (F1.5.2). For protecting the satellite from space environment (F1.6), the satellite should contain some functions including protecting satellite from solar radiation (F1.6.1), protecting satellite from effect of temperature cycle that the temperature in space changes a lot in short time (for example from -1000C to +1000C in several hours) (F1.6.2), protecting satellite from effect of different pressure between its inside and outside (F1.6.3). \\n Figure 62. Context diagram of DHS in nominal operations phase of MicroDragon satellite In nominal operations phase: The context diagram, Figure 62, shows interaction between the system of interest and the environment. The system of interest (DHS) gets space condition (temperature, vacuum, sun light, solar radiation, etc.) from space environment. Operators in the mission control center operate the satellite by sending CMD, and monitoring & analyzing TLM. In addition, the end-users interact with the system by sending feedback after receiving required data from the mission control center. In nominal phase, the satellite can perform the mission by capturing the pictures of targeted areas and implementing data downlink. This phase is different from the initial phase in a fact that both mission and housekeeping data are transmitted between the satellite and the ground segment in the nominal phase, while there is only \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 71 \\ntransmission of housekeeping data in the initial phase.  \\n Figure 63. Use case diagram of DHS in nominal operations phase of MicroDragon satellite The use case diagram in nominal phase, Figure 63, represents the interaction between the system of interest with the users including space environment, operators and end-users. In addition to the same use cases kept from the initial phase, some use cases related to mission data are considered, as in nominal phase, the satellite performs the mission. The first different use case comes from the satellite. The satellite has to record, store and process mission data from the payload devices in onboard memory. The second one comes from the mission control center, the mission control center receives, stores, and processes mission data. Besides, the mission control center has to analyze feedback and requirements from the end-users. Functional requirements in nominal phase can be derived from the context diagram shown in Figure 62 and the use case diagram described in Figure 63. There are some functions similar to those in the initial phase. The differences lie on functions related to mission data. The satellite has one high-level function to record, store, and send mission data (F2.7), as indicated in Figure 64. This high-level function can be broken down into several low-level functions including controlling satellite attitude over targeted areas (F2.7.1), recording required mission data (F2.7.2), storing mission data in onboard memory (F2.7.3), and sending mission data to the ground segment (F2.7.4). The \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 72 \\nfunction F2.7.1 should be included in the satellite, as sometimes, the satellite cannot vertically above the targeted areas, thus, the satellite attitude should be controlled to point to the want-to-capture-pictures areas. In addition to the same function with the initial phase, in the nominal phase, the ground station has one more function, which is transmission of mission data (F2.9). Figure 65 shows the functional requirements. When the satellite can communicate with the ground station, the collected mission data should be sent to the mission control center in order to store, process, and provide for the end-users. \\n Figure 64. Functional requirements (1) of DHS in nominal operations phase of MicroDragon satellite The functional requirements of mission control center in nominal phase are added to those in initial phase by two high-level functions. The first one is receiving, storing and processing mission data function (F2.12). This function is composed of several low-level functions including receiving mission data (F2.12.1), storing mission data (F2.12.2), and processing mission data (F2.12.3). The second one is analyzing requirements from the end-users (F2.13). This function is used to identify what kind of data the end-users want to have, which areas the satellite has to take the pictures, etc. This function also contains some low-level functions including getting requirements from end-users (F2.13.1), interpreting requirements (F2.13.2), and planning mission operations (F2.13.3). \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 73 \\n Figure 65.

As the satellite does not do the mission anymore, there is no mission data going through the system of interest \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 74 \\n(DHS), only TLM/ CMD are shared between the satellite and the ground segment.

Functional requirements derived from the context diagram and use case diagram in end-of-operations phase are shown in Figure 68. One new function is added in this phase, is that the feature of the satellite materials should include burnable property (F1.6’). While all functions of the ground station and the mission control center are the same with those in initial phase. To describe sequences of functions implemented in satellite data handling system, function flow block diagram (FFBD) is used, as shown in Figure 69. The satellite starts from initial operations to nominal operations, and ends at end-of-operations. In each high-level function, the sequences of low-level functions are defined. For example, some sequences including sequence of temperature control, sequence of supplying electric power, sequence of transmission of TLM/ CMD, and sequence of performing a mission, are to be described as bellows.  Figure 69. Function flow block diagram of DHS of MicroDragon satellite Figure 70 shows the sequence of temperature control in initial operations phase, the temperature of the satellite will be observed by temperature measuring function (F1.1.1), and controlled by thermal radiation function (F1.1.3), thermal insulation function (F1.1.4), and heating up function (F1.1.2). \\n Figure 70.

The satellite consists of 2 onboard computers, which are OBC and science data handling unit (SHU). The OBC is embedded with 2 onboard software programs including ADCS software and C&DH software. The ADCS software is used to collect Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 81 \\ntelemetry from ADCS sensors, and help the C&DH software to give decisions by appropriate algorithms. The C&DH software decides to send appropriate CMD to ADCS actuators to control the attitude. All the TLM/ CMD coming from/ going to the satellite have to pass CSSDS transport service embedded in OBC. The CCSDS transport service is connected to S-band transponder (STRX) of communication subsystem.  \\n Figure 75. Horizontal architecture of DHS of MicroDragon satellite In science data handling unit, mission data processing software has interface with mission payloads and CCSDS transport service embedded in SHU. This CCSDS transport service is connected to X-band transmitter (XTX).  Radio frequency link between the satellite and the ground segment is described as the frequency link between the satellite antennas and the ground station antennas. In mission control center, there is also a CCSDS transport service to code and decode the data sent from/ received in the mission control center. In addition, the mission control center also includes operations monitor and control, which is used to generate command, receive and analyze telemetry.  All the interfaces and links in DHS of MicroDragon are shown in Figure 75.  4.2.1.2. Vertical architecture design of DHS of MicroDragon satellite Vertical architecture designed in this research adds upper-layers data interfaces to those, which are already described in horizontal architecture. The upper-layers data interfaces in vertical architecture are categorized into 3 layers including application layer, data link layer and physical link layer. The way of design of vertical architecture allows verification of upper-layers data interfaces at low-level test, and results in shortened unexpected iteration development processes, thus, reducing development risks of increasing development cost and time compared to that verification of those upper-layers interfaces is postponed until system-level tests.

Vertical architecture of DHS of MicroDragon satellite As it is described in Figure 76, three layers of interfaces of vertical architecture exist in DHS of MicroDragon satellite. The application interfaces consists of ADCS TLM interface between ADCS software embed in OBC and operations monitor and control of the mission control center, mission data interface between mission data processing software and operations monitor and control, and TLM/CMD interface between C&DH software and operations monitor and control. The data link interface connects two CCSDS transport services of OBC and SHU to CCSDS transport service of the mission control center. The RF interface describes the connection between the satellite antennas and the ground station antennas. 4.2.2. Verification of MicroDragon DHS  Verification of MicroDragon DHS is implemented by using TableSat facilities in Tokyo University. Because of lacking mission data and mission payload components, verification of mission data cannot be done. The TableSat layout is in Figure 17.  To test TLM/CMD interface and physical link interface, the testing layout is set up as in Figure 77. This figure also shows data interfaces between DAS computer and PCU/ PCDU in application layer (red-colored lines), and between DAS computer and MOBC in data link layer (green-colors line). \\nData Handling  H/W \\nAttitude Control H/W \\nPower Supply & Thermal Control  H/W \\nCOM H/W \\nGround Station H/W \\nMission Control  H/W \\nRadio Frequency TLM/CMD TLM/CMD Packets \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nData Handling  Application S/W \\nCCSDS Transport Service \\nMission Control Application  S/W \\nMission Control  S/W Data Handling S/W H/W: Hardware S/W: Software  \\nApplication Layer Data Link Layer Physical Layer \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 83 \\n Figure 77. Testing TLM/ CMD layout with TableSat in Tokyo University The testing configuration is set as in Figure 80. DAS computer is connected to onboard computer (MOBC) via cables. MOBC receives TLM from and send CMD to PCU/PDU via RS422 interface. PCU and PDU have internal connection. PCU is supplied by a +28V-direct current (DC) power. PDU supplies +5VDC power to checkout equipment, which plays as satellite components (for example, gyro, sun sensor, etc.). Verification of CMD and TLM: Sending CMD from DAS computer to MOBC to turn on/ off satellite components (check out equipment), illustrated in Figure 78. If one the component is on, the corresponding LED of checkout component will be on. Therefore, it can check ON/ OFF status of components by checking LEDs status in checkout component. There is a camera put in ground station room to observe LEDs on/off status, as it is shown in Figure 79.  \\nMOBC \\nPDU \\nPCU \\nDAS Computer \\nDC Power Supply \\nTLM/CMD  Ground Station - Room Satellite - Room \\nDC Power Supply \\nCheckout)Equipment)\\n+28V +5V +28V \\nTLM/ CMD CCSDS Packets +28V TLM/CMD  \\nTLM/CMD  TLM/CMD  \\nCoaxial cable Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 84 \\n Figure 78. Sending CMD from DAS computer to MOBC in one TableSat activity Reception of TLM in ground segment is confirmed by checking telemetry monitor screen, illustrated in Figure 81. Description of experiment: The experiment procedures are described as in Table 10. The experiment was implemented through multiple steps. At first, DAS computer and MOBC were turned on before starting sending CMD from DAS to MOBC. In other parts, PCU was turned on first because it supplied electrical power to PDU, and PDU supplied electrical power for other components. In this experiment, PCU and PDU supplied electrical power to turn on LEDs in checkout equipment. After sending CMD, some TLM related to the CMD, which showed that MOBC had already received CMD, such as CMD counter in MOBC, were checked. Besides, some other TLM were also monitored as evidence of implementation of the CMD.  Table 10.

Monitoring TLM in one TableSat activity 4.3. Applying the approach to develop DHS of the data relay satellite system The data relay satellite system is designed to increase the amount of time that the satellite is in communication with the ground station, and improve the amount of data, which can be transferred. In this research, an imaginary data relay satellite system is introduced, consisting of a low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite and its ground segment, and a geostationary (GEO) satellite and its ground segment. The data relay satellite system is shown in Figure 47. The mechanism of the data relay satellite system is as follows. The LEO satellite sends its collected data to the GEO satellite, then the GEO satellite downlink the data to its GEO ground segment. Followed by that the GEO ground station sends the data to the LEO ground station by dedicated cables, such as Sinet in Japan. As the GEO satellite can always communicate with it ground station and the amount of time that the LEO satellite can talk with the GEO satellite is bigger than the time amount that the LEO satellite can talk with its ground station, thus, increasing the amount of time in communication between the LEO satellite and its ground station. The approach is applied to design and verify data handling system of the data relay satellite system. DHS design of the data relay satellite system includes horizontal \\nMaster’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 88 \\narchitecture, and vertical architecture. The horizontal architecture is illustrated in Figure 82. Mission data and housekeeping data of the satellite 1 are collected by science data handling unit and onboard computer, and then these data are packed and sent to communication subsystem of the satellite 1 by CCSDS transport service 1. The satellite 2 can receive these data by antenna systems in two satellites via RF layer. These data are stored in onboard memory of the satellite 2, and then sent to the ground segment 2. From the ground segment 2, these data are sent to ground segment 1 through dedicated cables. The vertical architecture is illustrated in Figure 82. This architecture is represented in 3 layers including application layer, data link layer, and physical layer. As the satellite 2 does not need to understand the satellite 1, the application layer only consists data interfaces between the satellite 1 and its ground segment, which are ADCS TLM interface, other TLM interface, and mission data interface. The data link layer represents CCSDS packets between two satellites, and two ground segments. These two CCSDS transport services embedded in onboard computers of two satellites, and in mission control centers of two ground segments must be compatible. Finally, physical layer represents RF links between two satellites, and two ground segments. Verification of DHS of the data relay satellite system is done with testing compatibility of CCSDS services embedded in two satellites, and testing RF link. Besides, application layer is tested in the same way with MicroDragon satellite. Verification of compatibility of CCSDS services embedded in two satellites is done by connecting 3 personal computers which are embedded two CCSDS transport services as in Figure 83. This testing configuration is built because normally GEO satellite (the satellite 2) had been launched before starting development of the satellite 1, thus, it is impossible to test with onboard computer of the satellite 2. TLM data are generated from computer 1, and then packed by CCSDS transport service 1 before being sent to computer 2 and computer 3. In computer 3, data packets are de-packed, and displayed. If displayed data in computer 3 are similar to generated data in computer 1, the compatibility of two CCSDS transport services is confirmed.

Verification of RF links of DHS of the data relay satellite system  Verification of RF link between two satellites: as GEO satellite is already launched so that testing configuration is built with virtual antenna of the satellite 2. The configuration is arranged as in Figure 84. To verify RF layers of two satellites, antenna of the satellite 1, virtual antenna of satellite 2 and virtual antenna of ground station 1, are put in 3 separate rooms. Between room 1 and room 2, there is a small hole 1, and between room 2 and room 3, there is a small hole 2. The hole 1 and 2 are made in such a way that there is no RF signal transmitted between room 1 and room 3. Input signal is generated from room 1 or room 2, and output signal is displayed in one device in the other of two rooms. If displayed signal is the same with generated signal, RF link between two satellites is confirmed.  Verification of RF link between the satellite 1 and its ground station can be done in the same way with end-to-end test for RF layer in Figure 42. Besides, the verification can also done as in Figure 84. Antenna of the satellite 1 is tested with virtual antenna of ground station 1. If the displayed signal in one end is the same with generated signal in the other end, the RF link between the satellite 1 and its ground station is confirmed.  \\nSat ANT 1 \\nSat  Virtual ANT 2 \\nGS  Virtual ANT 1 \\nSignal Generation \\nSignal Receiver & Display \\nSignal Generation \\nSignal Receiver & Display Satellite Ground  Station \\nANT 1 \\nGS  Virtual ANT 1 \\nSignal Generation \\nSignal Receiver & Display \\nSignal Generation \\nSignal Receiver & Display Satellite Ground  Station \\n1.

Interview with satellite specialists The interviews are done with five satellite specialists in Tokyo University, and Keio University. Eighteen questions are given to make surveys on understandability, usability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, as described in Table 7. The following is the results obtained in the interviews including comments and answers of the interviewees. 4.4.1. Interviewee No. 1 The answers of the interviewee No.1 are shown in Table 11. He thought that the idea of the approach was very interesting and impressive. Based on his experience of development of many satellite in Tokyo University, many projects faced problems of increasing development time and cost because iteration designing and testing processes consume a lot of time. He thought that the approach could help to shorten the iteration process but the verification method of the approach should be described in more detail. He suggested that the verification of upper-layer interfaces usually suffered from constraints from the lower-layers, such as data throughputs constraint, time constraint, to name a few, so that to make the verification more reliable, these constraints should be realized.

In his opinions, operational design should be vertical architecture, instead of horizontal architecture. So that he thought that description of the approach was not clear enough to understand how to design and verify satellite data handling system. However, in his point of view, the concept of testing upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing was a great idea to reduce development risks by shortening iteration development processes. He suggested that the approach should be explained more systematically so that it would be easier for satellite developers to design and test data handling system. Besides, using colors to represent interface layers should be identical from figures to figures to help others have better understanding. Table 14.

Discussion and conclusion on results of evaluation of the approach 4.5.1. Results of applying the approach to develop DHS of MicroDragon satellite  Architecture of DHS of MicroDragon satellite is designed based on the approach. In opinions of all the interviewed satellite specialists, the result of architecture design is good.  MicroDragon satellite has not integrated yet. Currently, engineering model of some component is available. Besides, the ground segment has yet to be developed. For those reasons, it seems impossible to test telemetry and command in application layer at the moment. However, by applying the approach, a simple testing configuration for verification of telemetry and command in application layer was built based on onboard computer and onboard software of MicroDragon, and TableSat facilities at Tokyo University. The testing results can confirm data interfaces in application layer, data link layer, and RF layer. The confirmation of data interfaces in this early phase of development of MicroDragon satellite is very useful for saving development time and cost. If the confirmation is postponed until the satellite is integrated, and some unexpected problems are detected during system-level tests, it will consume a lot of time to de-integrate the satellite, identify and fix the problems, and then re-integrate the satellite. Success of identifying & testing application layer with CMD & TLM of data handling system of MicroDragon satellite based on vertical architecture design following the approach, proves testability of upper-layers before integration with the approach. Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 112 \\n4.5.2. Results of applying the approach to develop DHS of a data relay satellite system  The data relay satellite system is a complex system of systems. Confirmation of mutual understanding among systems is challenging yet necessary because of difficulties of identifying how data interfaces in each layer can be verified. As this approach supports visualization of architectural layers, it offers easier way to imagine how data handling system can be tested in each layer, as it is seen in Error! Reference source not found.. With the help of architecture design, it is possible to confirm upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing, even for a complex system like the data relay satellite system. During interviews with some satellite specialists, they were impressive with design of data handling system of the data relay satellite system, and they thought the approach was a useful way to design and verify architecture of the complex satellite system, as architectural-layer visualization in the approach makes it easier to understand the system. Representation of upper-layers interfaces in data handling system architecture of complex systems, such as data relay satellite system, shows the importance and efficiency of the approach. 4.5.3. Results of interviewing satellite specialists   The interview results are shown in Table 11,Table 12, Table 13, Table 14, and Table 15. The differences of the results show different viewpoints of the interviewees. The viewpoint is decided by personal opinions, background of interviewees, and situations occurred during the interviews. The actual satellite developers tend to focus on applying the approach to actual satellite development projects, and design of data handling system of an actual satellite, and realization of verification configuration with constraints from hardware and software, for example how to realize time response, and distortion of short pulses in hardware components with software simulators. While system engineering people tend to concentrate on applying system engineering to design the approach, and to describe the approach in a systematical way, to make designing and verifying processes to be traceable and identical. However, in general, all the interviewees found that the approach was interesting, applicable, and had the originality and some advantages over previous approaches in terms of reducing development risks. Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 113 \\nBesides, they also agreed that the design of data handling system of MicroDragon satellite and the data relay satellite system by applying the approach were good.  Based on interview results, it can be concluded that the approach is highly applicable, effective and objective achievable.  In conclusion, the evaluation results show that the approach works and supports verification of layered interfaces in early phases, which allows to reduce iteration testing processes and development risks.             Master’s Dissertation                                            2016  \\n 114 \\nChapter 5   Conclusion 5.1. Summary The research has introduced a new approach to satellite data handling system for architectural-layer-driven verification. The approach consists of two parts including design of architecture of DHS, and verification of DHS. To support verification of upper-layers interfaces at low-level testing, two types of architecture call “horizontal” & “vertical” architecture are designed. The horizontal architecture is an architecture designed in operational domain and systems domain by using operational view and systems view of DoDAF. The vertical architecture is designed with vertical viewpoint to show architectural-layers in the system.  Evaluation of the approach is done by applying the approach to MicroDragon satellite, a data relay satellite system, and interviewing 5 satellite specialists from universities and space industry. Evaluation results show that the approach works, has originality and high applicability. Besides, it is understandable, usable, effective, and objective-achievable. The approach supports in confirming understandings among subsystems in a system, or among systems in a system of systems yet it also causes number of tests increase, which results in growth of development cost. Therefore, the approach should only be applied to development of a new data handling system where early confirmation of understandings among subsystems is very important, rather than be applied to production line. 5.2. Future work  As the proposed approach focuses on designing process of data handling system rather than verification configuration which is already stable and saturated in space industry, performance verification of data handling system which is actually out of scope of the current research is yet to be mentioned in the approach. Performance verification can be done in future as extension of the approach.

1\\nIntroduction\\nThe research presented in this thesis explores the potential of, and develops a frame-\\nwork for, the application of fractionated satellite systems to science-dedicated Earth\\nobservation missions. The majority of satellites are actually designed according to\\namonolithic (or conventional) architecture; this simply means that a satellite is an\\nautonomous machine, able to accomplish its mission and to provide by itself to its\\nneeds (power, communications, attitude control) and only requires a minimum, peri-\\nodical, human supervision. This approach has proven to be extremely functional and\\nsuccessful, as the last sixty years of space exploration demonstrate. However, over the\\nyears, some non-optimal features of the conventional satellites have been highlighted:\\nthey tend to be single-designed, thus leading to expensive re-design every time a new\\nmission is proposed, subject to performances degradation and instruments ageing,\\nwith minimum-to-none components standardisation, that result (among the others)\\nin time-consuming integration and validation processes and limited End Of Life (EOL)\\npossibilities apart from decommission. Furthermore large satellites are more likely to\\nexceed initial allocated \\x0cnancial and temporal budgets, thus possibly leading to the\\ncancellation of the whole project in spite of a part of the spacecraft has already been\\ndeveloped and build.\\nSeveral solutions have been proposed to address these undesirable characteristics:\\nan innovative approach proposes to physically separate the subsystems into di\\x0berent\\nmodules exploiting a wireless interconnection [BE06b]. A module itself is a single-task\\ndesigned satellite and can be added, or exchanged, independently from the others, as\\nwell as be reused over di\\x0berent missions, Fig. 1.1. Such an architecture is labelled as\\nfractioned satellites [BE06a] to highlight the physical distribution of functionalities\\n(e.g. power generation, telecommunication, etc.) over a cluster of orbiting elements.4 Introduction\\nFigure 1.1: F6 fractionated satellite concept, Courtesy of DARPA\\nThe resultant distributed system can be seen as a free-\\rying payload supported by\\nfree-\\rying service modules. In general, the paradigm shift towards using a multiple-\\nsatellite cluster has also been fuelled by the perceived advantages of increased robust-\\nness, greater \\rexibility, and in order to accomplish the large-scale geometries imposed\\nby speci\\x0cc science objectives [WHMK12, GWHR12]. Small distributed spacecraft\\ncould also guarantee better coverage than monolithic with almost comparable perfor-\\nmances due to sensors miniaturisation [TK12].\\nThere are many ways to implement the fractionation [MW06]. By interpreting liter-\\nally the idea, it is possible to de-couple entirely the subsystems using di\\x0berent modules\\nthus creating a completely heterogeneous system. In order to cut down the costs it\\nseems reasonable to produce standard buses for every subsystems. Nonetheless a com-\\nplete functional decomposition with the current technology not only is impractical,\\nit is physically impossible. Every module must be able to provide by itself to basic\\nfunctions like power distribution or thermal control as well as structural integrity.\\nThus the most logic con\\x0cguration for a fractionated spacecraft is a combination of\\nshared resources and module-owned properties [MW06, LC08].\\nApart from design issue, operation phase poses a new class of challenges by itself:\\nsatellites have been considered and designed as stand-alone elements. No coopera-\\ntion among di\\x0berent satellites was needed and the ongoing missions involving several\\nsatellites working on a single project are a composition of self-standing spacecraft\\nthat observe the same phenomenon using dissimilar instruments or from a diverse\\nperspective. The Cluster mission [RCWS93] and the A-Train [PWK06] are good\\nexamples of this philosophy: in spite of being composed of multiple (and even hetero-\\ngeneous) satellites they do not require interactions among them, basically they only\\nwork on the same topic. The introduction of the fractionated approach requires a\\nnew methodology to control and coordinate the spacecraft system\\'s e\\x0borts in order\\nto guarantee that remote resources will be gathered and distributed according to the\\nsatellites needs; furthermore the proposed concept has been thought to be scalable to\\nlarge systems, possibly involving tenth of di\\x0berent elements. The operational costs\\nof monitoring and commanding a large \\reet of close-orbiting satellites is likely to1.1 Fractionated Satellites 5\\nbe unreasonable unless the on-board software is su\\x0eciently autonomous, robust, and\\nre-con\\x0cgurable [Mue06]. The \\x0crst step in inter-satellite cooperation has been made\\nalmost two decades ago, with the commissioning of the \\x0crst Tracking and Data Relay\\nSatellite (TDRS) [Wea12]; working as remote data storage and re-transmission hub,\\nit could be interpreted as a form of fractionation of the communication system, that\\nlead to augmented performances of the connected elements due to the downlinks\\'\\nlarger bandwidth and duration compared with the traditional Space-Earth connec-\\ntions. However fractionation not only o\\x0bers a possible increment is satellite capacities,\\nbut it requires new methods to address the design and test the foreseen performances;\\nthe challenge for space engineers is to \\x0cnd the way to obtain the advantages that such\\na philosophy involves.\\nThe aim of this work is to develop a methodology to optimise the performances of\\na series of wireless connected spacecraft is order to compare them with a traditional\\ndesign satellite.\\n1.1 Fractionated Satellites\\nSatellites are complex and expensive systems envisioned to operate in a hostile en-\\nvironment that reduces their reliability over time. Due to the challenges they must\\nface, their design is limited to the essential requirements provide by the mission pay-\\nloads. Many methods have been o\\x0bered for enhancing spacecraft \\rexibility, including\\non-orbit satellite servicing [Lon05, Rey99, JH06], staged constellation deployment\\n[ddC03], and on-orbit software upgrades [Nil05]. Each of these methods involves one\\nor more value-enhancing attributes, that could be collectively called as design \\rexi-\\nbility: this can take the form of capability restoration, capability augmentation, risk\\ndiversi\\x0ccation, schedule diversi\\x0ccation, or uncoupling of system requirements. A pro-\\nposed architectural approach that could enhance the lifecycle value of a spacecraft\\nthrough \\rexibility is the adoption of a fractionated satellite architecture [BE06b].\\nA fractionated architecture is one in which the spacecraft system is decomposed into\\nmultiple modules which interact wirelessly to deliver at least the same capability as\\nthat provided by a comparable traditional, monolithic system [BE06a]. There are\\nfundamentally 2 possible approaches to fractionation: heterogeneous and homoge-\\nneous. The former foresees that the original spacecraft is decomposed into function-\\nally dissimilar modules. For instance, a spacecraft with a separate payload, tracking\\ntelemetry and communications, and computation and data handling modules would\\nbe considered to be fractionated into three heterogeneous modules, Fig. 1.2. The\\nlatter, homogeneous fractionation, is applied when a spacecraft is decomposed into a\\nnumber of identical modules. A possible example of this could be the constellation\\noriginally designed for the Terrestrial Planet Finder mission [HLA+04] with multiple\\nidentical sensing satellites serving as a distributed aperture in space. With either\\ntype of fractionation, one of the critical driving factors is the level of connectivity6 Introduction\\nFigure 1.2: Heterogeneous fractionation\\nbetween the separate modules: what resources have to be distributed, how, to what\\nextend are questions that must be answered during the preliminary design phase in\\norder to guarantee that the resulting system will behave consistently. However, there\\nis no rule-of-thumb to decide the fractionation level or how to implement it, thus the\\ndevelopment of a metric to evaluate the performances as a function of the adopted\\ncon\\x0cguration is required.\\nThere are signi\\x0ccant possible advantages related to this kind of design [BE06b]:\\n/x88Diversi\\x0ccation of launch and on-orbit failure risk\\n/x88Reliability enhancement through emergent sharing of subsystem resources\\n/x88Scalability in response to service demand \\ructuations\\n/x88Upgrade-ability in response to technological obsolescence\\n/x88Incremental deployment of capability to orbit\\n/x88Graceful degradation of capability on-orbit\\n/x88Robustness in response to funding \\ructuations and requirements changes\\n/x88Reduced integration and testing due to subsystem decoupling\\n/x88Production learning across multiple similar modules\\n/x88Enabling spacecraft to be launched on smaller launch vehicles with shorter time-\\nscales\\n/x88Requirements diversi\\x0ccation1.1 Fractionated Satellites 7\\nBy requirements diversi\\x0ccation is here intended that if service subsystems (or at\\nleast most of them) are removed from the module that carries the payload, this\\ncould be designed and operated according to payload functions only -i.e. attitude\\nthen would be non longer constrained by solar panels, thermal radiator or antenna\\norientation-. The paradigm is largely based on last years advances in wireless and\\nnetwork-related technologies, mainly developed for terrestrial applications, as well\\nas the increased di\\x0busion of micro-satellites (that already exploit some of the listed\\nadvantages) [VBM+11]. Technologies like self-forming networks [KSP99], secure wire-\\nless communication [YNK01], distributed computing [FKT01] can be considered ripe\\nand ready for deployment. Contrary-wise, other aspects of fractionation are not so\\nwell established: as en example, e\\x0ecient wireless power transfer, although several\\nproof-of-concept exist, is still in development phase.\\nThis highlights one of the main disadvantage of the proposed architecture: some of\\nthe involved technologies are not yet fully mature and therefore their exploit requires\\nfurther research and development. Furthermore fractionation can neither fully replace\\nthe on-board subsystems nor it can be applied to every subsystems; minimum as well\\nas non-distributive functionalities must be guaranteed on all modules, leading to the\\nduplication of some functions and hardware. As a result, the initial cost of such a\\nsystem is expected to be higher than that of a monolith, whereas the lifecycle cost is\\nexpected to be lower [BE06b, BE06a].\\n1.1.1 System F6 program\\nThe Future, Fast, Flexible, Fractionated Free-\\rying Spacecraft United by Information\\nExchange or F6 program was a DARPA funded initiative to investigate and realise a\\nspacecraft system with a fractionated architecture [rep10]. It was predicated on the\\ndevelopment of open interface standards- from the physical wireless link layer, through\\nthe network protocol stack, and including the real-time resource sharing middle-ware\\nand cluster \\right logic-that can enable the emergence of a space \\\\global commons\"\\nwhich would enhance the mutual security posture of all participants through interde-\\npendence.\\nA key program goal was the industry-wide promulgation of these open interface stan-\\ndards for the sustainment and development of future fractionated systems. The pro-\\ngram would have culminated with an on-orbit demonstration in mid 2015 of the\\nkey functional attributes of fractionated architectures. The on-orbit demonstration\\nwould have taken place in LEO, and would have been approximately six months in\\nduration, with a potential subsequent residual capability demonstration lasting up\\nto 18 months. The successful completion of these on-orbit demonstrations constitute\\nthe high-level objectives of the program, from which proposers and performers were\\nexpected to derive system-, subsystem-, and component-level objectives:\\n/x88Capability for semi-autonomous long-duration maintenance of a cluster and\\ncluster network, and to add and remove spacecraft modules to/from the cluster8 Introduction\\nand cluster network.\\n/x88Capability to securely share resources across the cluster network with real time\\nguarantees and among payloads or users in multiple security domains.\\n/x88Capability to autonomously recon\\x0cgure the cluster to retain safety- and mission\\ncritical functionalities in the face of network degradation or component failures.\\n/x88Capability to perform a defensive cluster scatter and re-gather manoeuvre to\\nrapidly evade a debris-like threat; the planning and execution of the scatter and\\nre-gather manoeuvres shall be performed without intervention or communica-\\ntion from ground operations.\\nIn 2008, DARPA announced that contracts for the preliminary development phase of\\nthe System F6 program were issued to teams headed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin,\\nNorthrop Grumman, and Orbital Sciences. The second phase of the program was\\nawarded to Orbital Sciences, along with IBM and JPL, in December 2009 mission\\nbut later terminated that deal. The agency restructured the program, distributing\\nwork among several small companies and universities, with none assigned the lead\\nintegrator role. The lack of rationale behind the leaderless contracting structure,\\nsoftware development delays and contractor performance issues, and \\x0cnally the fact\\nthat System F6 demonstration did not have a traditional mission -such as imaging-\\nresulted in program cancellation on May 17, 2013 [Spaa].\\n1.2 Automated Satellite Design\\nSeveral systems engineering tools exist for space systems design. Most of them have\\nbeen developed by di\\x0berent organisations with di\\x0berent uses in mind. Tab. 1.1 lists\\nsome of the major systems engineering tools in use today for space systems design\\n(several others already exist or are under developed at the time of writing). Private\\ncompanies (The Aerospace Corporation, Ball Aerospace), universities and space agen-\\ncies have created tools oriented according to their main area of interest (e.g. planetary\\nexploration missions for NASA and ESA, commercial, communication satellites for\\nstakeholders companies) thus leading not only to the realisation of software but in\\nsome cases dedicated concurrent design facilities to provide computer-aided analysis,\\ndesign, and trade studies for the missions [SBMF10]. It is worthy to highlight that\\napart from the Multiobjective, Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Systems Ar-\\nchitecting Methodology (MMDOSA), the other tools are focused on the design of a\\nsingle spacecraft rather than an entire distributed satellite system.\\nAccording to literature review, only one fractionated satellite system engineering tool\\nhave been developed so far [Tat12]; its authors have integrated the fractionated con-\\ncept within an existing satellite design optimisation methodology.\\nThe implementation of a new tool instead of the modi\\x0ccation of a pre-existing one\\nhas been preferred considering:1.2 Automated Satellite Design 9\\nName Organisation Use\\nCOBRAThe Aerospace Automated assessment of program cost risk\\nCorporation and schedule risk as a function of spacecraft\\ncomplexity for interplanetary missions [Bea00]\\nCEAThe Aerospace Mapping of \"what if\" cost and performance\\nCorporation trade studies for Air Force missions [WL96]\\nESSAM Univ. of Colorado Small Satellite bus component selection [Rid98]\\nGENSATComputational Object-oriented software that interconnects\\nTechnologies existing commercial satellite subsystem tools\\nand component databases [BPS95]\\nICE CalTechConcept de\\x0cnition of novel space missions\\nvia integrated information systems [SSW98]\\nMERITThe Aerospace Automated assessment of the cost and\\nCorporation performance implications of inserting existing\\nvs. new technologies into a spacecraft bus\\nMIDAS JPLAnalysis of proposed spacecraft designs via\\ntool executions on distributed machines [FCM+97]\\nModelsat ROUTES Cost and mass modelling for comms satellites\\nPTM JPLCost and performance prediction of novel\\ninterplanetary and space science missions [Bri95]\\nQUICK JPLSpacecraft design programming language\\nwith extensive component databases and\\nscaling relationships for spacecraft design [Ski92]\\nSCOUTThe Aerospace Single spacecraft mission bus component\\nCorporation and launch vehicle selection [Mos98]\\nSMALLSATNASA Langley Earth observation spacecraft sensor and\\nResearch Center satellite bus con\\x0cguration [Gre92]\\nSpaSat Ball AerospaceA preliminary spacecraft sizing, cost\\nestimating orbital analysis tool\\nMMDOSA MITMultiobjective MDO for the conceptual\\ndesign of distributed satellite systems [Jil02]\\nSPIDR USCAn arti\\x0ccial intelligence-based search and\\noptimization engine for conventional and\\nfractionated satellite systems [Tat12]\\nTable 1.1: Space Systems Engineering Tools10 Introduction\\n/x88availability: most of the listed software are commercial or free-to-use for research\\nand academics for only USA-based organisations.\\n/x88customizability: fractionation requirements are radically di\\x0berent from tradi-\\ntional satellites, thus requiring an open-source tool to perform all the necessary\\nmodi\\x0ccations.\\n/x88close-the-loop necessity: the aim of the work is to design and test the satellite\\nsystem, then outputs in the form of metrics and costs will not su\\x0ece to this end\\n-the whole spacecraft design, including the component list are required-\\n1.3 Satellite Simulation\\nBy de\\x0cnition, simulation is an imitative representation of a real-world system that\\nallows its operator to examine functions, attributes, and behaviours that may not be\\npractical to deal with using direct analysis or experimentation. Given a set of inputs,\\na simulation uses a model(s) to provide a set of outputs. Simulations are commonly\\nused to deal quantitatively with large, complex systems for which there does not exist\\nan analytic system of equations with a closed-form solution [SC95]. Spacecraft are a\\nperfect example of this kind of systems as they exploit (among the others) non-linear\\nattitude and motion dynamics, time-changing mass properties, non-uniform temper-\\nature distribution with time and orientation related boundary conditions. Simulation\\nactivities have a vital role to play in supporting operation, research and development\\nboth for existing and under study satellite systems. Commonly targeted tasks are:\\n/x88Mission de\\x0cnition and demonstration\\n/x88Crew training\\n/x88Design, prototyping and veri\\x0ccation of systems\\n/x88Supporting software validation\\n/x88Mission/system (end-to-end) modelling\\n/x88Attitude and Orbit Control System, Trajectory, Guidance and Control, Navi-\\ngation simulators\\n/x88Mathematical analysis models of payloads systems\\n/x88Demonstration and promoting of space systems by real-time visualisation\\nHowever, in spite of their importance, satellite simulations has been mostly inves-\\ntigated keeping a certain degree of separation between the functionalities: the dy-\\nnamical contribute -orbit and attitude- and electro-mechanical part -the subsystems-.\\nThe former are analysed in order to evaluate the in\\ruence of the perturbations and\\nthe e\\x0bectiveness of the control system, the latter to check speci\\x0cc parameters under\\ncontrolled (critical) conditions.\\nAs a result, structure and granularity of models required by subsystems vary greatly1.3 Satellite Simulation 11\\ncompared to those developed for simulation and control. Mirroring, and causing in\\npart the wide gap between techniques under research at labs and the ones being\\nutilised on operational spacecraft, is the distance between the \\x0cdelity and repre-\\nsentativeness of models in use at research centres and the proprietary simulations\\ndeveloped in industry [IATM+12]. Satellites, compared to other types of machinery,\\nhave a tighter bond with their environment: its in\\ruence determines the capacity\\nto generate power, the temperature, the possibility of communicate and operate.\\nTo exacerbate the problem, boundary conditions a\\x0bect the spacecraft regardless for\\nfunctional distinctions that have been made by designers: simulators dedicated to\\nthe power generation take the solar panel temperature as a given parameter, whereas\\nit is a function of the orbit, attitude and dissipated power [LCKL88]. Similarly\\nthermal analysts base their work on given attitude and power load under nominal\\nconditions. When subsystems are analysed singularly, there is a loss of information\\ndue to the non considered cross-in\\ruences among them. In order to investigate these\\naspects the commonly used aggregate models, such as transfer functions and state\\nspace descriptions, have limited applications and multi-system models of component\\nbehaviour are required. In order to e\\x0bectively introduce the fractionated concept in\\nthe simulation framework, a speci\\x0cc focus on subsystem performances and available\\nresources is required: the satellite system will operate under shared resource condi-\\ntions, thus their evaluation as a function of time, attitude, operative conditions is\\nas important as the relative position and orientation of the spacecraft. Furthermore\\nthese analysis must include the mutual in\\ruences among the subsystems.

Tab. 1.2 reports some possible examples of simulation\\ntools that have been developed for commercial and research applications that already\\nexploit these functionalities. None of them allow the execution of the tested and\\nvalidated sub-system (e.g. the AOCS control loop) \\\\in context\", together with sim-\\nulated equipment (e.g. thermal, power, communications) in a dedicated simulation\\nenvironment. STK has a commercial licence that includes data management, sensors\\nand Telemetry Tracking and Command (TT&C) analysis but has limited power and\\nthermal capacities that could be integrated using external tools via plug-ins[Ana11].12 Introduction\\nOpen-SESSAME was stated as a master thesis project and then further developed\\n[TH03]; distributed with a GNU licence is mainly dedicated to orbital and attitude\\naspects with related communication evaluation possibilities. The Goddard Satellite\\nData Simulator Unit (G-SDSU) is a payload-oriented tool that enables users to insert\\ntheir own satellite simulator to convert model-simulated atmosphere states to various\\ntypes of satellite observable signals [NASb]. SIMSAT is a general-purpose real-time\\nsimulation infrastructure developed for the European Space Agency; it comes with a\\nvariety of semi-standard models for ground modelling, environment mode ling etc.,\\nwithin a reference architecture [Whi07]. ESA\\'s The Virtual Spacecraft Reference Fa-\\ncility is a simulation facility where under proposed satellites can be extensively tested,\\nincluding subsystem, components, on-board software with or without hardware in the\\nloop; however, being a facility and not just a tool its exploitation within the contest\\nof this work could not be possible[ESAb]. None of the mentioned projects in its o\\x0b-\\nthe-shelf version satis\\x0ces the distribute satellites interaction and subsystems models\\nrequirements that are required in order to be able to simulate the operation of a frac-\\ntionated satellite system. The required extensive modi\\x0ccations could be implemented\\non the open-source software only, reducing the range of the possible choices. Due to\\nsimilar consideration done for the available engineering tools and the time required to\\nintroduce the required adjustments, the development of a dedicated simulation tool\\nhas been preferred.CHAPTER 2\\nThesis Overview\\nThe goal of this research is to develop a methodology to design and simulate dis-\\ntributed satellite systems in order to evaluate quantitatively how fractionation a\\x0bects\\nnot only the cost of the system, but also its performances once deployed. This aim\\nrequires both preliminary design and operation phase to be analysed: no satellites\\nwith fractioned architecture actually exist, so there is not a benchmark that could be\\nused as reference.\\nThe simulation phase could be implemented only when a candidate spacecraft is\\nprovided; and in order to design a satellite with such a peculiar concept, extensive\\nmodi\\x0ccations to current design methods are required. Furthermore the unique fea-\\ntures introduced by the resource sharing are beyond tradition spacecraft operations,\\nthus needing an ad hoc tool to consider and test them. In order to compare the\\nperformances of the fractionated system with an analogous monolithic satellite, ob-\\njective quantities have to be evaluated, like the total cost of the spacecraft including\\nestimated development and research, ground support, construction, integration and\\nlaunch. The speci\\x0cc objectives of the proposed research follow:\\n/x88To develop a framework to address the design of a distributed and cooperative\\nsatellite system with shared resources.\\n/x88To analyse from the operative point of view the implication of the fractioned\\napproach.\\n/x88To develop a methodology to evaluate the performances of the created satellite.\\nIn order to achieve the speci\\x0ced objectives, the thesis could have been divided, both\\nfrom temporal and logic points of view, into 5 main topics, depicted in Fig. 2.1:14 Thesis Overview\\n/x88Satellite design\\n/x88Fractioned spacecraft design\\n/x88Design optimisation\\n/x88Satellite operations\\n/x88Multiple satellite operations\\nFigure 2.1: Thesis overview\\nEach of them covers a speci\\x0cc aspect of the work that had to be done in order to\\nunderstand the real potentialities of the fractionated approach. The task\\'s division has\\nbeen originated from the study and the analysis of the concept, both using literature,\\nand a priori knowledge of satellite design and operation. The result was the idea\\nthat, from a functional perspective, fractionated spacecraft systems could be seen as\\na more generic approach to satellite deployment, Fig. 2.2-a (whereas from a built-\\nso-far standpoint is exactly the opposite, distributed systems are a small subset of\\nthe traditional satellites, Fig 2.2-b). When the whole spacecraft system is considered,\\nfractioned modules possess all the basic capacities of the monolithic elements plus\\nadvanced cooperative modes enabled by their additional hardware. According to\\n(a)\\n (b)\\nFigure 2.2: Satellite classi\\x0ccations, functional (a) and by number of build elements(b)\\nthese considerations, the logic consequence was to develop a framework that could2.1 Satellite design 15\\nanalyse a generic spacecraft system; in this sense, a traditional satellite could be\\nseen as a sub-case of distribute/cooperative systems where the number of involved\\nspacecraft is equal to the unity and no resources are shared. But it could also be\\napplied to heterogeneous systems like nowadays science-satellites that rely on the\\nTDRS or similar data-rely spacecraft.\\nStructure and steps required to full-\\x0cll the main objectives are hereby discussed in\\nthe following sections.\\n2.1 Satellite design\\nAs anticipated, the lack of a reference fractionated satellite constitutes a non-negligible\\nproblem: without a satellite that could be studied, the development of a metric to\\nestimate its performances would not have any sense. This poses the initial require-\\nment for an engineering tool able to address the preliminary design of a spacecraft,\\nextensively described in Chap. 3. The speci\\x0cc objective of the tool are:\\n/x88The capacity to design a science-dedicated LEO satellite with a reasonable de-\\ngree of con\\x0cdence\\n/x88Provide subsystem power and mass budget, main components list and reliability\\n/x88Include the possibility for additional hardware and requirements modi\\x0ccation\\nrelated to resource sharing\\n/x88Accept external additional constraints like speci\\x0cc launchers or ground stations\\n/x88Sustain and pass a validation campaign using existing satellites as reference\\nThe words \\\\with a reasonable degree of con\\x0cdence\" refer to the fact that such an\\nengineering tool has to face (and solve) within minutes the same problem that an\\nequip of senior engineers and mission technicians would solve in hours or days; their\\nexperience and considerations could hardly be translated into a software. However\\nthe objective is to obtain a simpli\\x0ced spacecraft that is compatible in terms of mass,\\npower and con\\x0cguration with the analogous system designed by specialists.\\n2.2 Fractioned spacecraft design & Design optimi-\\nsation\\nThis part of the work has been speci\\x0ccally addressed to the impact of fractionation\\non the spacecraft system design; there are several unknowns related to the resource\\nsharing. Some of the involved technologies, especially for power transfer, are still un-\\nder test and development and, according to literature, there is a great variability in\\ncurrent and estimated performances. Furthermore as no fractionated spacecraft exist,16 Thesis Overview\\nthere are no data about the in\\ruence of the distribute resources on cost or operative\\nfeatures.\\nIn order to design a fractionated spacecraft system with the under analysis con\\x0cgu-\\nration, numerous tasks had to be performed:\\n/x88Identi\\x0ccation of possible shared resources\\n/x88Analysis of their current (or near future) TRL\\n/x88Study of the necessary additional hardware and satellite requirements modi\\x0c-\\ncation\\n/x88Introduce coherent hardware constrains on master and dependant satellites\\n/x88Evaluate the e\\x0bects on cost and mass parameters due to di\\x0berent type of frac-\\ntionation (di\\x0berent and amount of resources)\\n/x88Use fractions as free variables to optimise the spacecraft system\\n/x88Minimise launch vehicle cost according to the new con\\x0cguration\\n/x88Calculate the cost of the entire system\\nThe optimisation is necessary both for design analysis and feasibility of the operation\\nphase: \\x0crstly as the whole concept is still on paper, no one really knows how e\\x0bective\\nit could be (although some literature is available on this point, once again not all\\nof the authors are unanimous [BE06b, BLSE07, O\\'N10, Spaa]). The exploit of an\\noptimisation tool would allow to evaluate how di\\x0berent fractions a\\x0bect the spacecraft\\nin combination with the original requirements originated by the mission payload.\\nSecondly improper con\\x0cgurations would emerge during the operation phase, produc-\\ning meaningless simulations: i.e. if all the satellites have the capacity to communicate\\nwith the ground station, they would not need to cooperate among them.\\nFractioned spacecraft design will be discussed in Chap. 4. The results achieved\\nincluding the optimisation loop in the design phase will be presented in Chap. 7,\\nincluding a brief description of the used method, \\x0ctness value calculation and conver-\\ngence performances.\\n2.3 Single & Multiple Satellite Operations\\nThe operation phase is aimed at simulate the behaviour of the satellite during its\\norbit; when design is coherent with the requirements and the spacecraft is operating\\nunder nominal conditions, simulations has little utility. However due to the particular\\nfeatures introduced by the fractionation, the operative phase has been modelled to\\ntest the additional e\\x0bects due to having spacecraft that have to access resources that\\nare not located within the vehicle frame and to provide a framework that could be2.3 Single & Multiple Satellite Operations 17\\nused in the future to validate cooperation schemes.\\nSingle satellite operation, depicted in Chap. 5 has been the \\x0crst step taken in this\\ndirection.\\nThe simulated model should include:\\n/x88Orbit and attitude evolution including e\\x0bects due to disturbances and controls\\n/x88Power subsystem, with evaluations of generated (solar panels), consumed and\\navailable (batteries) power\\n/x88TT&C subsystems, including long (ground station) and short (other satellites)\\nrange connections\\n/x88Thermal subsystem, able to evaluate the satellite components temperature and\\nto control them using heaters\\n/x88Propulsion subsystem\\n/x88Attitude control system with simpli\\x0ced actuator models whose used power and\\npropellant in\\ruence Electrical Power System (EPS) and propulsion systems re-\\nspectively\\n/x88GNC algorithm\\nConsiderable attention has been given to subsystems mutual in\\ruences, identi\\x0ced\\nthrough an a priory analysis.\\nAdditional requirements for multiple satellite simulations include:\\n/x88Cooperation model for communication\\n/x88Relative attitude and position evaluation\\n/x88Upgrade of GNC algorithm to manage multiple spacecraft\\nThe development of a distributed heterogeneous simulation infrastructure is also de-\\nscribed in Chap. 6, which will serve as a test bed for modelling and simulation\\nactivities.CHAPTER 3\\nSatellite Design\\nSpacecraft system design is a multi-disciplinary, labour-intensive, costly, and time\\nconsuming process that considers the mission objectives, payload, structure, orbit\\nand attitude dynamics, thermal control, communication, power supply, as well as\\nother parameters [Rid98]. Is typically addressed by gathering subsystem experts\\nthat create and update design concepts over the time-scale of days, merging analyses\\nfrom various heterogeneous modelling tools. Technology could automate and possibly\\noptimise the spacecraft design process to lower costs (and time) while maintaining\\nreliability. Due to the prohibitively expansive search-able space implied in spacecraft\\ndesign, many tools have been based on limited subset of design variables and empirical\\nformulas [Rid98, ADL98]. The key problem to consider lies in choosing the modelling\\ntechnique and implementing an optimisation strategy. The following chapter describes\\nhow automated satellite has been treated, highlighting limits and made simpli\\x0cer\\nassumptions.\\n3.1 Satellite Assembly Procedure\\nThe Satellite Assembly Procedure (SAP) is an iterative algorithm created to address\\nboth the preliminary design of conventional satellite and a more specialised cluster of\\ntask-dedicated modules, according to the provided requirements; its main structure\\nis represented in Fig. 3.1. The global outputs are the features of each subsystem, the\\npart-list of the main components and the overall properties of the resulting satellite:\\n/x88Mass (dry, wet and estimated adapter), Center Of Gravity (COG) position with\\nrespect to main structure and inertia tensor20 Satellite Design\\nFigure 3.1: Satellite Assembly Procedure3.1 Satellite Assembly Procedure 21\\n/x88Costs (research and development, ground supports, launch, for theoretical \\x0crst\\nunit and following elements)\\n/x88Geometry and dimensions (operation phase and folded), impact parameter \\x0c,\\nsolar array surface\\n/x88Power (maximum and minimum, operation and navigation phases), battery\\ncapacity, solar panels output\\n/x88Downlink/Uplink Data Rate (DR), both science and telemetry\\n/x88On-board memory and operations per second\\n/x88Systems and satellite reliability\\nAn integrated single/multiple satellite Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)\\nhas been considered but later discarded due to complexity issues highlighted by lit-\\nerature review [CDF+94, Rec91]. Instead, a simpler bottom-up approach has been\\nselected: starting from high level requirements and payload features, satellite subsys-\\ntems are assembled one at a time, updating and using the under-construction solution\\nas revised input. The reasons behind the choice of a less sophisticated and heuristic\\nsolver, instead of a more complete one, have been basically time-related; the analysis,\\ndesign and implementation of a MDO tool would have been hardly compatible with\\nthe available time frame. Furthermore the single satellite model is only a part of\\na larger optimisation process, thus the exploit of a tool able to provide reasonable\\nresults in a short time scale (minutes or less) had been of primary interest. The\\nspace state of the solutions has been restricted by a priori considerations that have\\nlimited the number of possible technologies and approaches to those that are com-\\npatible with the science-oriented, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites; these constrains\\nare hereafter reported for every analysed subsystem. At each subsystem level, a set\\nof feasible/compatible solutions is created, and a \\x0ctness based on a weighted average\\nof mass, power and cost is calculated for every element in the set. By changing the\\nbalance between the weights, mass/power/cost saving solutions can be preferred; un-\\nless otherwise speci\\x0ced, only the mass weight is used. The satellite is designed as an\\nassembly of local optimum; the procedure is then repeated as long as stopping criteria\\nare not satis\\x0ced. The main criteria is the achievement of a stable solution; stability is\\nintended as marginal di\\x0berences between two consequent iterations ( \\x06:1%). Param-\\neters tested for convergence are dry and wet mass, maximum and minimum power\\n(both operation and navigation phases), science and telemetry DRs, storage memory.\\nAlso con\\x0cguration, as main components part-list, is checked. A similar mechanic is\\nexploited at subsystem level, thus preventing unnecessary re-design when the input\\nparameters are unchanged. As fail-safe condition, a limit on the maximum number\\nof iterations has been included. Simulations highlighted that a few iterations are\\nenough to produce a stable solution, Fig .3.2; the \\x0crst iteration is dominated by the\\npayload (and fraction parameters), whereas the second and following iterations are\\nalso in\\ruenced by the previously constructed subsystems.

In some cases the algorithm highlighted an oscil-\\nlatory behaviour ( \\x1515 iterations); the reason has been identi\\x0ced in a combination of\\n(typically) two subsystems, each of them with at least two similar feasible solutions\\nand cross-connected input-outputs that cause the procedure to switch back and forth\\none solution. Even in these cases the complete solution has shown minimal changes in\\noverall parameters. In general, there are no guarantees neither that a solution exists,\\nnor that it is unique.\\nAlgorithm failures arise from:\\n/x88Constrains violation at subsystem level (e.g. insu\\x0ecient reliability, Sec. 3.2, or\\nno components in the available database that match requirements)\\n/x88General con\\x0cguration issues (total mass over available launcher capability)\\nFurthermore as the design is derived from the sum of locally optimal elements, the\\ncomplete satellite can be a non-globally optimal solution. A validation campaign has\\nbeen performed by comparison of actually build satellites with they SAP designed\\ncounterparts; used inputs have been orbital features, lifetime and payloads character-\\nistics. Results are reported in Sec. 3.4. A short description of the design and sizing\\nprocedure followed for each subsystem is reported.\\n3.1.1 Inputs\\nThere are 3 classes of input parameters/constrains:3.1 Satellite Assembly Procedure 23\\n/x88General constrains: introduced from high-level design choices (partially dictated\\nby the subsequent operation phase).\\n/x88Payload features: used to describe quantitatively the payload in terms of di-\\nmension, mass, inertia, required power, generated telemetry and scienti\\x0cc DRs,\\npointing accuracy and thermal limits.\\n/x88Fraction parameters: communicate if and how the satellite under construction\\nis connected with other satellites (they will be discussed in Chap. 4).\\nConsidered constrains include mission lifetime, operation (and transfer) orbit parame-\\nters, restrictions on available launchers (e.g. EU only) or ground stations (a particular\\nnetwork or a speci\\x0cc station). Those parameters could arise from political and bud-\\nget concerns instead of technical considerations, thus they have been distinct from\\nengineering issues. Performances reduction over time (solar cell e\\x0eciency, battery\\ncapacity, thermal coatings) are also considered during design phase.\\n3.1.2 Payload\\nThe satellite is assembled in order to support and ensure payloads operations, pro-\\nviding structural integrity, attitude pointing/stability, thermal control, power supply,\\ndata analysis and download. Payloads parameters are \\x0cxed as the SAP is not allowed\\nto modify them. Ensured inputs are:\\n/x88Name, type (e.g. telescope, Synthetic Aperture Radar)\\n/x88Mechanical features -mass, dimension, inertia, main axis-\\n/x88Thermal properties -maximum and minimum survival and operation tempera-\\nture, dissipated heat, heat capacity, surface absorptivity and emissivity-\\n/x88Power requirements -maximum and minimum power during di\\x0berent mission\\nphases-\\n/x88Attitude constrains -knowledge, stability, twist rate-\\n/x88Science and telemetry DRs during operation phase\\n/x88Average duty cycle per orbit\\n/x88Design \\\\short-cuts\"\\nUsually payload and satellite design are (at least for some aspects) simultaneous,\\nwhereas SAP assumes the payloads as a \\x0cxed input; two parameters have been used\\nto counterbalance this lack of cross-in\\ruences using information from real satellite\\ncon\\x0cguration to introduce (if necessary) payload autonomous thermal control and\\non-platform mount. When multiple payloads are provided, mass and power inputs\\nare combined to generate the worst design case (i.e. both payloads active at the same\\ntime) whereas the tightest thermal and accuracy requirements are used.24 Satellite Design\\n3.1.3 Command and Data Handling\\nThe Command and Data Handling (C&DH) system performs two major functions:\\nit receives, validates, decodes, and distribute commands to other subsystems and\\ngathers, processes, and formats housekeeping and mission data for downlink or use\\nby an on-board computer [LW99]. Due to its functions it is directly in\\ruenced by\\nthe TT&C subsystem and by the features of the payload. Preliminary sizing of\\nthis subsystem is not a trivial task; although some of the required functions can be\\nidenti\\x0ced with a reasonable degree of con\\x0cdence, there is a consistent number of tasks\\n(with consequent computational load, hardware, command output channels, number\\nof stored commands) that require a more detailed design phase in order to be correctly\\nestimated. C&DH used architectures can be generally classi\\x0ced as:\\n/x88Single-unit systems, \\\\all-in-one solution\", a single unit provides all commands\\nand telemetry functions. However centralised systems installed on large space-\\ncraft bus would require a massive wire harness in order to connect all subsystems\\nand associated interfaces and heath monitors.\\n/x88Multiple-unit, distributed systems, on the contrary are made from several phys-\\nically separated units connected to the subsystems and a single \\\\central\"block.\\n/x88Integrated systems combine command, telemetry, \\right processing and attitude\\ncontrol into one system. A central high-performance processor is in charge of\\nmonitoring and controlling simpler, subsystem level, units.\\nSAP-C&DH module has been largely based on the multiple-unit approach; a cen-\\ntral element controls remote units, each in charge for a speci\\x0cc subsystem; multiple\\nreasons are behind this choice: it allows functional decoupling (simplifying the suc-\\ncessive operation-phase simulation), divides satellite control from subsystem speci\\x0cc\\ncommands execution (thus the C&DH elements sizing can consider only high level\\nfunctions whereas local boards deal with low-level telemetry gathering and commands\\nexecution). In this sense, data handling tasks can be thought as performed by two\\nmain functional blocks: data elaboration and storage. In order to size the C&DH,\\nrequired reliability, number of required operations and storage capacity are consid-\\nered; two classes of database entries are compared with the requirements, on-board\\ncomputers, with both process and storage capacities, ( Npelements) and storage units\\n(Nmoccurrences). Inputs depend on payload requirements as well as other subsys-\\ntems commands and telemetry needs (calculated during their own assembly phases).\\nC&DH construction has been resumed within Alg. 1; basically it compares the re-\\nquirements with the available computer elements. If they are satis\\x0ced, the possible\\nsolution is saved, otherwise if the problem is a lack in capacity, a couple computer\\nplus additional storage supports solution is evaluated. Reliability is considered, and\\nif needed back-up elements are added to the solution too, as well as estimated harness\\nmass. The possible solutions are evaluated in order to \\x0cnd the best-\\x0ctness one.3.1 Satellite Assembly Procedure 25\\nAlgorithm 1 C&DH Assembly\\n1:fori= 1 to Npdo .Cycle over on-board computers\\n2: ifconstrain (computer ijoperations; reliability )then\\n3: ifconstrain (computer ijstorage )then\\n4: Estimate harness\\n5: Solution ( computer i)\\n6: Add Solution to V\\n7: else\\n8: forj= 1 to Nmdo .Cycle on storage devices\\n9: ifconstrain (computer i+storage jjstorage; realibility )then\\n10: Estimate harness\\n11: Solution ( computer i; storage j)\\n12: Add to V\\n13: end if\\n14: end for\\n15: end if\\n16: end if\\n17:end for\\n18:Search for bestsolution\\n19:return C&DH Solution\\n3.1.4 Telemetry Tracking and Command\\nThe TT&C provides the interface between the spacecraft and the ground systems (or\\nanother spacecraft) [LW99]. Commonly it is a two directions communication system,\\nallowing the passage of payload mission data and satellite housekeeping information\\nto the operation centre as well as the reception of users issued commands. Main op-\\nerations include carrier tracking (mandatory to lock onto an external source/target),\\ncommand reception, telemetry modulation and transmission, ranging as well as sub-\\nsystem operations. Sizing process (schematically reported in Alg. 2) is based on\\nrequirements and constrains estimated both from high-level prerequisites and sub-\\nsystem level inputs. Determine requirements includes the analysis of orbit, range,\\ncoverage, DR, volume and bit error rate; if no user de\\x0cned constrains are introduced,\\nfrequency (S, C, X, Ku and Ka bands) is treated as a free design variable. More likely,\\nrestrictions on available Ground Station (GS) and international regulations will re-\\nstrain the available channels. Components sizing based on link budget [LW99, FSS11]\\nallows to \\x0cnd a solution that minimise a speci\\x0ced cost function (like mass or required\\npower) without violations of requirements and constrains. The TT&C has been di-\\nvided in three main areas of in\\ruence (with a certain abuse of terminology), Fig. 3.3;\\nthe transceiver units have been designed to handle mainly telemetry and commands,\\nwhereas large-volume science-data download has been addressed with a dedicated\\ntransmission line. The two separate channels have di\\x0berent antenna con\\x0cgurations\\n(wide beam, low gain and limited beam, high gain respectively).

When multiple solutions are available (for example\\nseveral frequencies are available or more than one GS can be used), a candidate that\\nresponds at best to the mass, power or cost reduction parameters is selected. Involved\\ncomponents are added to the global list, while mass and power budgets are updated.\\nAdditional parts like antenna pointing mechanisms or thermal coatings are provided\\nduring the design of the respective subsystems.\\n3.1.5 Attitude Determination and Control System\\nThe Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) stabilises the spacecraft\\nand orients it in the desired directions during the mission in spite of the external\\ndisturbances [LW99]. This requires both the capacity to determine the attitude, us-\\ning sensors, and to control it, by means of actuators. Entry point for subsystem\\ndesign are mission requirements (type of payload, required accuracy, slew rate), pro-\\n\\x0cle and orbital features. These lead to speci\\x0cc ADCS requirements and constrain\\nthat restrain the possible subsystem con\\x0cguration (e.g. pointing accuracy tighter\\nthat 0 :01\\x0ecan be hardly achieved with horizon sensors and magnetorquers whereas\\nthey are a commonly found feature of Star Tracker (ST)/Reaction Wheel (RW) sys-\\ntems). Due to the focus on Earth observation satellites with high pointing accuracy,\\nso far only 3-axis stabilised systems have been considered. A resume of used coupling\\nrequirements-technologies can be found in Tab. 3.1. In order to allow regular desat-\\nuration manoeuvres, RW and Control Moment Gyro (CMG) must be coupled either\\nwith Hydrazine Thruster (hTH), Cold Gas Thruster (cgTH) or Magnetorquer (MT).\\nNumber and con\\x0cguration of the actuators are automatically constrained by their\\ntype: RWs and CMGs are placed to form a four-sided pyramid, MTs are disposed\\northogonally and parallel to the geometric axes. A total of 12 thrusters is required\\nto ensure a 3 rotational degrees of freedom attitude control.

In order to evaluate with an automated fashion the\\nexpected temperature ranges of the satellite several tasks have to be performed:\\n1.Identi\\x0ccation of the heat sources: external (LEO assumed, orbital parameters\\nare known) and internal (from component list, dissipated power of every ele-\\nments is an input parameter)\\n2.Creation of a simpli\\x0ced thermal model\\n3.Identi\\x0ccation of the worst hot and cold cases;\\n4.Selection of passive thermal control components: materials, coatings, paints\\n5.Evaluation of the components temperature during hot and cold cases\\nThe brie\\ry summarised points involve a considerable e\\x0bort; point 1 is quite straight-\\nforward within the limits of the used simpli\\x0ccations. Point 2 in considerably more\\ncomplicated; it can be divided into two main operations: construction of the model\\nfrom a mathematical point of view and the identi\\x0ccation of the numerical data re-\\nquired to \\x0cll it. The spacecraft has been represented using a lumped mass [IDBL07];\\na single thermal node depicts the satellite with its internal heat generation (elec-\\ntronic components losses) and external \\ruxes (Sun, albedo, deep space). Additional\\nhypothesis have been made to identify the worst design cases:\\n/x88Worst Case Hot (WCH), payload at peak power, all other components at nom-\\ninal power, direct sunlight, albedo and Earth IR\\n/x88Worst Case Cold (WCC), all components at standby power and eclipse condi-\\ntions\\nThe design of the Thermal Control System (TCS), Alg. 6 must ensure that each\\ncomponents temperature is kept within acceptable ranges (minimum and maximum\\noperative with a 15\\x0eCmargin); as the spacecraft is considered as a single body, the\\ntightest combination of minimum and maximum temperature is considered. The aim\\nof the algorithm is to \\x0cnd a combination of satellite coating, radiator and eventually\\nheaters such that constrains are satis\\x0ced. The properties of a \\x0cnite number of coatings\\nNc(white and black paints, metallised kapton, MLI) are used to evaluate the end-of-\\nlife temperatures (WCC and WCH) of the single-node satellite (assuming a uniform\\ncoverage). If the constrains are not respected, additional components are added to\\nthe solution until design conditions are satis\\x0ced (if possible). Purely passive solutions\\nare promoted; however if temperature variation exceed limits, typically due to cold\\ncases, patch heaters can be used to increase dissipated heat, at cost of additional\\npower to be provided by the EPS. The mass increment due to the increased power\\nsubsystem complexity is considered during bestsolution selection.

Mechanical design has been simpli\\x0ced; a structural idealisation of the\\nsatellite has been used. Alg. 7 returns dimension and thickness of the main struc-\\nture and the con\\x0cguration of both internal and external components. Required input\\nparameters are:\\n/x88Launcher features, minimum axial and lateral frequency, load factors, fairing\\ndimensions\\n/x88List of the components with related mass, dimension and type\\nThe structure is assumed to be a 4-sides prism; width and height are evaluated using\\niteratively an algorithm designed to solve a three-dimensional bin packing problem\\n[MPV00]; given a set of rectangular-shaped boxes the algorithm returns the number\\nof assigned-dimension bins that are required to hold them all. Working in the reverse\\ndirection, it has been used to evaluate the minimum dimensions of a structure able\\nto contain all the mentioned elements; inner components are idealised by means of\\nrectangular boxes. A heuristic has been adopted to avoid that the geometry could\\nevolve towards thin beams or, on the opposite, \\rat plates; side ratio close to fairing\\ngeometry are encouraged. Inner elements con\\x0cguration returns both mass distribution\\nand base dimensions for the structural elements; then mechanical properties of the\\nproposed design are evaluated using a uniform beam model [LW99, GF04].

External components position is assigned according to their function\\nin order to avoid interferences. A certain degree of arbitrariness is used during this\\nphase; components are placed along the sides considering their tasks. Using satellite\\ngeometric reference system (+ Xnormal to the Earth-pointing side, Zalong vertical\\naxis), the standard arrangement is:\\n/x88+XPayloads, TT&C antennas and pointing mechanisms\\n/x88\\x06YSolar panels (including deployment systems and gimbals), attitude thruster\\n/x88+ZPayloads/antennas if needed\\n/x88\\x00XThermal radiator, Star Trackers\\n/x88\\x00ZMain thruster(s)\\nPayloads and antennas placement on + Xside has been performed using a 2d version\\nof the bin packing problem solver.

This has been done\\nby taking into account both components failure rate and their connections (series,\\nparallel, combinations). In order to achieve desired reliability level, both hot and\\ncold redundancies have been used. Trade-o\\x0bs between high-quality components and\\nless-reliable with backups are evaluated during subsystems assembly or similarly high-\\nperformance components opposed to less capable ones. Solutions including the former\\napproach turned out to be favourite during best solution selection for their lower mass;\\nfurthermore the latter concept could also fail in \\x0cnding a feasible solution due to the\\nexcessive parallel blocks that have to be added to achieve the required reliability level.\\nPartitioned redundancy [HH85] (elements connected both in series and in parallel)\\nhas been used to combine performances and reliability (e.g. 2 series of battery cells\\nwith cross-connection to reach both required capacity and ensure that a single element\\nfailure does not a\\x0bect a whole series).\\n3.3 Costs Model\\nCost is an engineering parameter that varies with physical parameters, technology\\nand management methods [LW99]. The cost of a spacecraft system depends, among36 Satellite Design\\nthe other, on its size, complexity, implemented technologies, desired lifecycle, design\\nand political considerations. Cost Estimating Relationship (CER)s are mathematical\\nequations that use regression techniques to establish a relationship between indepen-\\ndent variables that are representative of the design, and cost as the dependent variable\\n[boo08]. CERs can be applied at the system level (e.g. spacecraft, instrument), sub-\\nsystem level (e.g. attitude determination & control, optics) or component level (e.g.,\\nstar tracker, CCD). All cost models, in their basic form, have some underlying CER\\nde\\x0cned [boo08]. A variety of tools, both based on CER and with di\\x0berent approaches\\nhave been developed, Tab. 3.2; unfortunately none of them has been released for\\npublic use [NASc] or they are commercial products [KML05, ADL98].

Further-\\nmore the required databases are created by the same companies or organisations that\\ndevelop the cost estimation tool, therefore they are not public. Then, the creation\\nof the database would have been the \\x0crst step. Instead, simpli\\x0ced cost relationships\\nhave been retrieved from available literature. The models from [LW99] proved to be\\nantiquated as they include satellite built more than 30 years ago, thus being not so\\nrepresentative of later, improved designs. A more updated alternative has been iden-\\nti\\x0ced in [KKC12]; the multi-parameters CER engineered by the authors are based on\\nEarth observation satellites and in order to overcome the limitations of mass-based\\nprediction models, evaluation of the system complexity Index and cost correction re-3.4 Results 37\\nlationship are also applied to the cost model to increase the accuracy of the model\\n[KKC12]. Always according to the authors, their CERs have better degree of con\\x0c-\\ndence when applied to Earth-dedicated science satellites whose payload features are\\nknown. Costs related to launch, initial orbital transfer and commissioning have been\\ncalculated using launchers data-sheets. Personnel and ground support costs have been\\nevaluated using NASA\\'s Cost Estimation Toolkit (CET) Software Package [NASa].\\n3.4 Results\\nThe design tool has been tested using existing satellites with a wide range of payload\\nrequirements and orbits.

Extending Sentinel-1 design life\\nresulted in RW+MT ACS con\\x0cguration (but also increased the dry mass due\\nto additional redundant components).\\nGeneral con\\x0cgurations for ADC, TT&C and Propulsion subsystems have been sum-\\nmarised in Tab. 3.4; communication system solutions, in general, are the same, relying\\non X-band downlink for large volume science data and S-band channels for teleme-\\ntry/small volume science download and commands uplink. ADS and Propulsion show\\nsome diversities; as happened for Sentinel-1 balance between thruster and magnetor-\\nquers as desaturation actuators can be staggered by including extended operation\\ntime in consumables evaluation. When propulsion requirements are evaluated, the\\nproposed attitude solution that already includes 4 thrusters acting on a single side\\nis considered; if thrust requirements are satis\\x0ced the mass of the propellant required\\n(not including extra for life extension) could make the combined ADC/Propulsion\\nsystem preferable to separated attitude actuator (RW and MT) and dedicated or-\\nbital manoeuvres thrusters. Attitude determination for all the satellites (real and\\nre-designed) is based on star trackers and gyroscopes with additional magnetome-\\nters for those spacecrafts that have MT actuators; this has been caused by the high\\naccuracy requirements. Similarly foreseen thermal controls are all passive with addi-\\ntional heaters and radiators. As previously mentioned, EPS con\\x0cguration for Earth-\\nobservation satellites is almost standardised with limited variations in solar arrays\\narrangement.

The aim of the algorithm is to\\nengineer a group of satellites able to operate in a collaborative fashion.

Every data-block contains both constrained variables about payload and\\norbital features and design parameters describing how the module will contribute to\\nthe overall spacecraft by means of its shared resources (master/subordinate positions\\nfor every fractionated subsystems, amount of shared resources). Fractionation and\\nnumber of modules can be assigned or left as free variable, as well as the launch\\nvehicle selection. Subsequently, it changes fraction design parameters according to\\nthe feed-backs obtained through the ES and the IL. The input parameters evaluation\\ncreates requirements and constrains used to the feed the SAP according to:\\n/x88Mission type: main mission objective (as science or communication)\\n/x88Payloads: complete list of desired payloads and their requirements\\n/x88Fractions: resources that are required to be shared\\n/x88Budget: maximum a\\x0bordable budget\\n/x88Launchers: constrains on launchers class, type or number of launches\\nWhen multiple payloads and satellites are provided, their allocation is dealt as a\\ncombinatorial optimisation problem; payloads are assigned to di\\x0berent spacecraft\\nsimilarly to the \\\\knapsack problem\" [MT90]. The aim is to create input parame-\\nters that could lead to similar satellites, possibly increasing common design choices\\nand components; cost saving related to the exploit of a standard platform has been\\nconsidered. Preliminary mass and power estimations of proposed satellites born from\\npayloads/fraction parameters combinations [Bro03] are used as pay-o\\x0b metric for a\\ndynamic programming unbounded knapsack problem solver [MT90] (a restricted ver-\\nsion of the original problem, based on the hypothesis that all weight are non-negative\\nintegers). The solution time is pseudo-polynomial on the number of payloads and the\\nresult is instruments allocation over di\\x0berent spacecraft. The introduction of fraction-\\nation in SAP causes variation in foreseen hardware, operations and consequently on\\n\\x0cnal design result, Sec. 4.2. Multiple instances of the satellite assembly are created,\\ncoherently with number of spacecraft to be designed.\\n4.1.2 General Constrains Evaluation\\nThe GCE holds watch-dog functions over the SAPs; it ensures that the combination\\nof the proposed satellites still satis\\x0ces the high level requirements. Used control\\nparameters involve total mass, fairing dimension compatibility and budget issues. A\\nfailure in the requirements observance causes the free EIP output parameters (like\\nfractions or number of satellites) that generated the current solution to be changed.46 Fractionated Design\\n4.1.3 System Evaluation\\nThe SE performs the satellite-cluster-level performance evaluation; its objective is\\nto compare di\\x0berent spacecraft con\\x0cgurations searching for the one that obeys at\\nbest to the imposed constrains. Due to the tasks and the structure of the envisioned\\nalgorithm, the SE has been integrated with the IL in order to form the base for\\nthe optimisation process. Such constrains can be the mass or cost minimisation (or a\\nweighted sum of both); number of launches; minimum construction time spacecraft. A\\ngrade is assigned to the achieved solution allowing their comparison and thus providing\\na numerical \\x0ctness.\\n4.1.4 Iteration Loop\\nThe aim of the IL is to modify input parameters according to the achieved results; is\\nnot necessary for a single design whereas takes a fundamental role during optimisation.\\nDue to the non-linearity of the formulated problem [Mos96], identi\\x0ccation of cause-\\ne\\x0bect relationships between the module requirements and the overall spacecraft can be\\ndi\\x0ecult and hardly automatable. A population-based optimisation method has been\\nused to search for the best con\\x0cguration. The metric and the optimisation algorithm\\nare described in Chap. 7.\\n4.2 Shared Resources\\nAn essential attribute of fractionated spacecraft is their ability to physically decouple\\nsubsystems and payloads by placing them on di\\x0berent modules and, in doing so, en-\\nable the sharing of subsystem resources amongst modules via collaboration [BE06a].\\nDispersion and subsequent sharing of certain subsystem resources and functions re-\\nquires additional hardware both on the modules that provide the resources (Source\\nSatellite (SS) or master ) as well as those modules that rely on/receive the resources\\n(Recipient Satellite (RS) or slave). The hardware associated with each shared resource\\nmay be simple instantiations of current technology, as is in the case of distributed com-\\nmunication systems, or could require the application and demonstration of new(er)\\ntechnologies, as is the case of moving electrical power from one satellite to another.\\nFractionation could, at least theoretically, be applied to almost every subsystems\\n(structures for obvious reasons are not prone to be shared); various existing, under\\ndevelopment or under study technologies could directly or indirectly be applied to\\nthis mean. A priory analysis of the available or under development technologies that\\ncould be used to connect remote satellite subsystems have been performed in order\\nto select those whose features were compatible with the undergoing study.\\nA remote TCS would try and regulate the temperature of another spacecraft; temper-\\nature evaluation functionality could also be envisioned but would be limited to surface\\nanalysis, thus providing limited information about inner elements status. Thermal4.2 Shared Resources 47\\ncontrol could be achieved by providing energy to the dependant spacecraft in the\\nform of concentrated sunlight [SL89], laser [Gla68], or microwaves [Die80]; the main\\nadvantage would be a reduction in slave satellite power request (removing or reduc-\\ning heaters requirements) counterbalanced by a considerably larger increase in SS\\nmass and power due to the reduced e\\x0eciency of the energy transfer process. The\\ncost-bene\\x0ct of a cooling system such as using one spacecraft as shield to protect the\\nsubordinate from the direct sunlight would be extremely disadvantageous due to the\\ncomplexity of involved orbit and attitude control.\\nRemote propulsion aim is to generate a net force on an object without need for energy\\nsource or reaction mass (possibly both) on the object itself. Several methods have\\nbeen proposed, ranging from beam-powered approaches to magnetic repulsion. Beam-\\npowered propulsion can be further classi\\x0ced into laser [MF06], microwave [Par06],\\nconcentrated sun-rays [NKM+05]. In either cases, the main assumption is that mo-\\nmentum may be transferred to a spacecraft by promoting mass expulsion as in a\\nconventional rocket. Final spacecraft velocity is still limited by the rocket equation,\\nbut the objective is to reduce non-propellant mass and achieve high speci\\x0cc impulses.\\nBeams can be focused to speci\\x0cc component (absorber cavity or heat exchanger)\\nwhere energy is transferred to low molecular weight propellant; ablative propulsion\\nin which an external pulsed beam is used to burn o\\x0b a plasma plume from a solid\\nmetal propellant has also been proposed [PBL+10]. Magnetic repulsion can be used\\nto maintain a given distance between two satellites; a conventional propulsion system\\nis still required at least on one of them. Contact-less interaction similar to magnetic\\nsuspension is used to move the desired spacecraft. Involved problems are the com-\\nplexity of the required hardware, limited control capacity, additional requirements for\\ntight attitude and position control. At the state of the art, remote propulsion has a\\nlow Technology Readiness Level (TRL), reaching at best 4 with a ground prototype\\nof solar thermal rocket. In force of this consideration, remote propulsion has not been\\nconsidered in this work as his exploitation word require hardly accurate performances\\nextrapolation and mass or power estimations. A considered alternative is a com-\\nbination of on-board electric propulsion system alimented through a wireless power\\nsource. Pulsed plasma thruster, high-speci\\x0cc-impulse, low-power electric thrusters\\n[Bur98] have been selected as possible propulsion elements and integrated within the\\nSAP.\\nAttitude control is achieved by providing the spacecraft the capacity of actively or\\npassively modify its own angular momentum; traditionally this is obtained using\\nactuators or acting on satellite mass distribution. Remote attitude control can be\\nperformed using a satellite to change and regulate angular velocity and orientation of\\nanother spacecraft; interactions can be with or without contact. In the former case\\na docking/berthing manoeuvre is required, thus the attitude of the two spacecraft\\nis changed and \\x0cnally the non-controlled satellite is released; supplementary hard-\\nware for docking, relative attitude sensor, advanced GNC algorithms are required,\\nmaking it a technically possible (the privately-founded Mission Extension Vehicle is48 Fractionated Design\\nbased on a similar concept) although not convenient for continuous manoeuvres. The\\nlatter concept, contact-less attitude control could be performed constantly altering\\nthe strength of a magnetic \\x0celd produced by electromagnets using a feedback loop.\\nPermanent magnets, with electromagnets only used to stabilise the e\\x0bect could be\\nused to reduce the power requirements [Kon02]. Similarly, electrostatic charges can\\nbe used; current TRL is paused at ground experiments. Contrariwise, remote attitude\\ndetermination has been tested and quali\\x0ced, Sec. 4.4. The four remaining subsys-\\ntems, TT&C and Data Handling (DH), Attitude Determination and System (ADS)\\nand EPS have already demonstrated space-quali\\x0ced remote operation capacity (as for\\ncommunication and data handling) or like wireless power have a well established and\\ndocumented technical background and despite the lack of space-environment tests\\nproved its potential with \\x0celd experiments (TRL 6). A more detailed description of\\nthe selected fractionated subsystem is provided in the following sections.\\n4.3 EPS\\nThe power subsystem consists of two main elements: power generation and storage\\n(distribution, control and regulation are assumed implicit). These elements could\\nbe shared if an e\\x0bective way to transmit power without physical connections (i.e.\\ncables) is provided. In the case of shared power generation, a master satellite in a\\nfractionated spacecraft satis\\x0ces its own power requirements plus a part (or almost\\nall) of the power demand of one or more other modules. As a result, these dependent\\nsatellites have reduced power generation requirements, as they have to produce less\\n(or none of the) power than they require. In a similar fashion, shared power stor-\\nage consists in design a satellite with a storage capacity able to sustain both itself\\nand the target element that will be free to use smaller storage devices. Power is a\\nfundamental element in satellite design; energy production and storage capability is\\nthe base for all electronic components operation. Although fractionated approach\\nforesees that all required power generation and storage could be distributed, this\\nwould lead to a non-fail-safe design: whenever the main satellite in the formation\\nwould had a malfunction, not only science objectives of slaves spacecraft would be\\njeopardised but subsystems operation would be endangered by the lack of power. To\\navoid this criticality, an additional requirement has been add to designed spacecraft:\\nevery spacecraft has to be able to provide by itself enough power (and consequently\\nstorage) in order to execute basic operations like attitude control, power regulation,\\ndata handling, telemetry download. With this distinction, shared power is used to\\nfeed only navigation and science related operations.\\nEven if the conceptual design of the power share is pretty straightforward, its imple-\\nmentation encounters several technical problems, mainly related to the low e\\x0eciency\\nof the whole process. According to the distance between the emitter and receiver\\nsatellites, two main classes of contact-less power transfer strategies arise:4.3 EPS 49\\n/x88near \\x0celd (a meter or less) \\x00!electrodynamic induction, electrostatic induction,\\nresonant inductive coupling\\n/x88far \\x0celd (up to kilometres) \\x00!microwave, laser\\nAll the above mentioned techniques rely on electromagnetic waves, the distinction\\nis due to the e\\x0bective separation in relation to the used wavelength (near \\x141\\x15, far\\n\\x0celd>1\\x15). Near \\x0celd techniques have shown during experiments that the potential\\ne\\x0eciency can be high (up to 95% and higher in ideal cases), however they require\\naccurate positioning of transmitter and receiver elements; when distance and orien-\\ntation deviate from nominal conditions, e\\x0eciency rapidly decreases [SLR+09, BS11].\\nFocusing the attention on the far \\x0celd methods, both of the two technologies are cur-\\nrently investigated for their potential aerospace applications [NK10]. They share the\\nsame philosophy, a power generation unit converts electric energy into a focused, high\\npower-density, directional beam toward a target device able to convert this energy\\nback to its electric form [NFR+11a]. In the microwave transfer the generator unit is a\\nmicrowave emitter (like a magnetron or a klystron) and the receiver can be a rectenna\\nor a hemispherical antenna [RyLC04]; with the laser approach a solid state laser is\\nused to illuminate a special (optimised to work on a single wavelength) photo-voltaic\\npanel [BKB10]. The methods also share the same drawbacks, mainly beam pointing\\nproblems, di\\x0busion over long ranges and low overall e\\x0eciency (literature provides\\nseveral estimations, on \\x0celd 20% [NK10] DC-DC e\\x0eciency can be expected). For\\nLEO applications, satellites rely on solar arrays as main power source; low e\\x0eciency\\nenergy transmission results in large areas for the transmitter spacecraft. In order to\\nconcentrate, aim and steer the beam, focusing and pointing devices are required, thus\\nintroducing additional constrains on attitude and con\\x0cguration. Additional thermal\\nproblems arise both due to increased solar array surface as well as due to dissipated\\npower from emissive devices. Main features of laser and microwave beam technologies\\nhave been reported in Tab. 4.1. Microwave beam has additional losses due to RF\\nLaser Microwave\\nDC-RF converterSolid state laser Magnetron/Klystron\\n50% 83%\\nPointingMirror Phased array antenna\\n99% 90%\\nRF-DC converterAlGaAs photovoltaic cell GaAs diode rectenna array\\n59% 82.5%\\nTable 4.1: Laser and microwave power beaming comparison\\n\\x0clter insertion, beam coupling, propagation, collection and rectenna e\\x0eciency, DC to\\nutility grid e\\x0eciency that reduce the DC-DC e\\x0eciency to less than 45% [Dic03].

However, one of the aim of the fractionated design is to\\nremove non-payload related requirements (or at least reduce their in\\ruence) from\\nsatellite design; rectenna arrays size and relative orientation constrains are more de-\\nmanding than the laser-photovoltaic cell counterpart, especially if, to increase receiver\\ne\\x0eciency, a hemispherical re\\rector is used. Furthermore, laser beaming o\\x0bers a series\\nof design and operation advantages:\\n/x88Collimated monochromatic wave-front propagation allows narrow beam cross-\\nsection area for transmission over large distances\\n/x88No radio-frequency interference to existing radio communication (nonetheless,\\noptical instruments must be adequately screened)\\n/x88Current technical maturity and undergoing improvements in solid state lasers\\ne\\x0eciency (prototypes have achieved wall \\x11greater than 80% [PREZ07])\\nBased on these factors, laser power beaming has been selected to be employed in frac-\\ntionated spacecraft that share the power resource. Considering possible (and desired)\\nincreases in components e\\x0eciency, fractioned satellites have been designed considering\\nvariable levels of DC-DC e\\x0eciency, ranging from 25% (current technology) to 40%\\n(achievable with under development laser and Vertical Multi-junction photovoltaic\\ncells [NFR+11b, PREZ07])\\n4.3.1 Satellite Assembly Procedure variations\\nWhen fractionation is introduced, power production and management requirements\\ncan be increased/decreased according to designed role, Tab. 4.2; master modules have\\nto face the challenge of transfer power to the target satellite. This leads to increased\\nsolar panels surface and battery capacity, heavier and complex power distribution,\\nlaser and control unit (with associated thermal control). As in [BKB10] due to lim-\\nited available data about high power laser for space application, Commercial O\\x0b The\\nShelf (COTS) continuous wave solid state cutting lasers with liquid cooling systems\\nhave been used as baseline; pointing has been provided using speci\\x0ccation of com-\\nmunication optical heads and electronic units (a comparison with laser-based science\\ninstruments resulted in similar accuracy, mass and power requirements). The subordi-\\nnate on the other side has reduced nominal requirements leading to batteries and body\\nmounted solar panels to satisfy minimum survival needs coupled with panels support-\\ning monochrome cells to convert the laser beam. At SAP input level, shared EPS has\\nbeen controlled by the continuous parameter fract EPSwhose range is \\x061; 1 has been\\nused to identify a con\\x0cguration where the \\x0crstly designed satellite (that assumes the\\nrole of main ) acts as master for the rest of the formation, whereas \\x001 represents the\\nopposite condition, the main is served by the other spacecraft. The same parameter\\nalso controls the amount of power that will be interested by the remote operations:4.3 EPS 51\\nMaster Subordinate\\nGenerationall internal+ fundamentalP\\nNsnav; science subsystems\\nStorageeclipse, internal+ eclipse, fundamentalP\\nNsnav; science subsystems\\nTx/Rx powerP\\nNsnav; science navigation, science\\nHardwareLaser generator(s) + photovoltaic cells\\nLaser head(s) support panel(s) and mechs.\\nTable 4.2: Shared EPS requirements and hardware\\nthe range \\x061 has been mapped on the intervalP\\nNsfnav; science g \\x04science main.\\nAccording to this distribution, positive values correspond to designing the main with\\nshared EPS hardware able to deliver all (1) or a fraction ( <1) of the power used by\\nthe scienti\\x0cc instruments installed on the other satellites; likewise input parameters\\nfor those modules will be modi\\x0ced in order to reduce the portion of payload operations\\nthat they have to support. And contrary-wise values smaller that 0 are associated to\\nthe inversion of the roles, the main has become the subordinate element that receives\\nfrom the other(s) spacecraft; 0 itself identi\\x0ces a non-fractionated EPS.\\n4.3.2 E\\x0bects on mass and power\\nEPS fractionation has a massive in\\ruence on overall system mass; Fig. 4.2 shows the\\nevolution of system total mass (sum of all satellites) as a function of payload mass for\\ndi\\x0berent con\\x0cgurations and dc-dc e\\x0eciencies.

With this knowledge is possible to\\ncalculate the attitude of the second element in the global reference; by exploiting a\\nsimilar concept, if the second module can evaluate the relative attitude of the \\x0crst\\nmodule, it only needs the global orientation information of the \\x0crst spacecraft in order\\nto be able to identify its own absolute attitude. The shared ADS relies then relies\\non two features: relative attitude determination and inter-satellite communication.\\nSo far ADCS fractionation has been restricted to the sole attitude determination; in\\nspite of the existence of proposed remote attitude control technologies (mainly based\\non electrostatic or electromagnetic \\x0celds [Ahs07]) due to their low TRL (~2) they\\nhave not been considered so far (within literature highly variable -if not con\\ricting-\\ntechnical speci\\x0ccations and performances have been found). Sensors selection is also\\na\\x0bected by the position help by module itself: as the master satellite is responsible\\nboth for determining its own absolute state vector and evaluating the position of the\\nfunctionally connected modules, it carries a traditional instruments complement cou-\\npled with sensors dedicated to the evaluation of the relative attitude/position. The\\n\\x0crst function is achieved by di\\x0berent combinations of STs, IMUs, Sun and magnetic-\\n\\x0celd sensors (according to pointing accuracy requirements); the latter operation can\\nbe performed using various techniques; optical (CCD) [HM93], LIDAR [PG04], ra-\\ndiofrequency based [MG13] hardware and software have been already successfully\\nused. High resolution cameras have been selected as possible approach for relative\\nstate determination; advantages of this method include low power consumption, no\\nneed for dedicated hardware on chaser satellite (small markers could be introduced\\nwith minimum mass increase), adaptability to di\\x0berent targets [MSOM07, MBSA06].\\nSubordinate ADCS modules are not strictly required to be able to evaluate their atti-\\nMaster Subordinate\\nRequired absolute Highest-state accuracy of all PLs\\nRequired relative Highest Highest\\nstate accuracy of remote PLs on-board PLs\\nHardwareIMU+ST IMU\\nmultiple VPS VPS(s)\\nTable 4.3: Shared ADS requirements and hardware\\ntude autonomously; this implies that the (expensive) star tracker can be avoided and\\ncould be replaced with a simpler virtual positioning system (to have them in both4.4 ADS 55\\nsatellites gives a redundancy in case of failure of one of the two).

This solution would marginally increase\\nsystem complexity and cost but would allow for a limited operational capacity even\\nin case of subsystem de\\x0cciency on the main satellite. The other open point is raised\\nfrom the necessity to communicate the absolute and relative orientation of the satel-\\nlites among them: a short range link is required in order to accomplish this task, so\\nsimilarly to remote data handling, the remote attitude determination introduces a\\nconstrain on the communication subsystem. The designed link should ensure close\\nto real time data transfer, with the widest spatial coverage in order to avoid dead\\nzones and have embedded redundancy. Such subsystem could have a non negligible\\nimpact on the overall TT&C architecture as well as on the satellite con\\x0cguration.

Nominally, the ST are the most\\nexpensive and massive attitude determination instruments [Bir96, J.T86], followed by\\ninertial platforms, so replace them with simpler systems would be interesting. The\\nmodi\\x0ced SS has a traditional ADS with up to 6 (one per each side) groups of cam-\\neras; clusters of optical heads instead of a single one are justi\\x0ced by the needs of\\nboth resolution and width of the \\x0celd of view.

Cameras placement poses a problem of its own: the line of sight should\\nbe clear from obstacles like other instruments, antennas, solar panels; optics need\\nshielding from direct or refracted sunlight as well as rocket plumes. These are the\\nsame requirements that must be respected for ST and payloads, exacerbated by the\\nnumber of cameras (opposed to the single-dual star tracker heads).

Fig. 4.10-b also highlights that dual hubs con\\x0cgurations (a cluster where\\ntwo satellites have direct Ground-communication capacities) are penalised when com-\\npared to their simpler single hub counterparts. However in the normalised graph, for\\nlarger spacecraft, the two options lead to similar results; this is caused by the lower\\nin\\ruence on the TT&C on the total mass. Power-based graphs, Fig 4.11, basically\\ncon\\x0crm the same trend.

The used methodology\\ninvolves the development of models for the di\\x0berent elements (i.e. orbital and attitude\\ndynamics, payload physics, subsystems components) of a fractionated satellite system\\nin order to estimate what resources are available at any moment considering previous\\nsatellite operations as well as in\\ruences due to environment. Although satellite sim-\\nulators are not a novelty (as has been outlined in Sec. 1.3), most of the existing ones\\nare dedicated to a single system (orbital control) or functionally-coupled systems (at-\\ntitude and orbit control). Thermal analysis and electric components are commonly\\naddressed with COTS software whereas payloads have speci\\x0ccally-developed dedi-\\ncated models. The reliability and accuracy level of such tools is often outstanding,\\nbut usually they neglect the fall-outs induced by one subsystem on the others, thus\\nrequiring the user to iteratively update the subsystem parameters in one tool using\\nthe evaluations given by another one. As the number of used satellites increase, this\\nprocedure easily become unfeasible, especially if the main task of the simulation is to\\ntest inter-satellite interactions. The environment where the satellite operates has a\\nmajor in\\ruence both on design and on operation; as the intention is to test as realis-\\ntically as possible the system performances a detailed model of the Low Earth Orbit\\nis required. This allows the evaluation of orbital and attitude disturbances -Earth\\'s\\noblateness and irregular mass distribution, rare\\x0ced atmosphere, solar pressure- as\\nwell as available solar power -planetary ephemeris- and communication windows with\\none or more selected ground stations. In a distribute satellite tasks breakdown and\\nresources sharing are a key feature; in order to achieve these objectives, several steps\\nhave to be completed. At \\x0crst a correct estimation of the satellite status and available\\nresources is required. There are two concurrent requirements that a\\x0bect this aspect66 Single Spacecraft Operation\\nof the simulation: accuracy and \\rexibility. The modelled satellite is going to be the\\nsum of its subsystems, thus the greater the accuracy in every model, the greater the\\n\\x0cdelity of the resulting spacecraft; on the other hand a model that breaks-down ev-\\nery component of the satellite to its constitutive elements -i.e. divide a thruster into\\ncombustion chamber, feeding valves, valves switches, temperature sensor, nozzle, etc.-\\nwould lose \\rexibility and increase the time to assembly and validate the model. Com-\\nponents breakdown is made to test the performances and the design of the component\\nitself but this level of detail is rarely employed in subsystem models [PF98]. Every\\nsubsystem is represented by means of elements characterised by numerical features;\\nnumber and type of the properties depend on the class of component. This means\\nthat a component is regarded as a black-box characterised by mechanical, electrical,\\nthermal features with supplementary high-level attributes that are related to the ev-\\nery subsystems -i.e. an engine has speci\\x0cc impulse and thrust whereas an antenna\\nis characterised by gain and beam-width-. A node-based layered approach has been\\nadopted, as brie\\ry displayed in Fig. 5.1-a. The main idea is to divide the component\\nfeatures according to their functional in\\ruence on the di\\x0berent subsystems: e.g. the\\nmass could be considered a \\\\mechanical\" property as it in\\ruences the physical (in-\\ntended as classical mechanics) behaviour. A more generic mechanical group has been\\nincluded as structural dynamics has not been included in the simulation, attitude\\nand orbit considers only rigid body motion. Clearly this classi\\x0ccation is arbitrary\\nand commonly a property has in\\ruences that cannot be restricted to a single sub-\\nsystem. As an example heat capacity is an extensive property of matter, meaning\\nthat is proportional to the size of the system, thus mass in\\ruence can be detected\\nalso during thermal analysis. When a single feature had multiple implications, the\\none that required no additional information to a\\x0bect a system has been assumed as\\npart of the main layer. With respect to the previous example, classical mechanics is\\ndirectly ruled by the mass of object, whereas heat capacity is the product of mass and\\nspeci\\x0cc heat capacity (a property that is \\\\owned\" by the thermal subsystem). Every\\nset of features de\\x0cnes a layer; the complete -within the adopted simpli\\x0ccation limits-\\ndescription of a component is given by the merging of the di\\x0berent layers. Informa-\\ntion exchange between layers is possible through a direct inheritance sequence; this\\nallows to keep track of the e\\x0bect of the variations of the component status through\\nthe subsystems. An example of such inheritance/layered structure is shown in Fig.\\n5.1-b. The hierarchy automatically implies that features must be attached coherently:\\na transmitter in order to work uses power (thus requiring the electrical properties)\\nwith non-perfect e\\x0eciency, causing dissipation that modi\\x0ces its temperature as well\\nas those of the nearby components (thermal layer); the thermal e\\x0bects could be eval-\\nuated only knowing mass and con\\x0cguration of the parts that constitute the satellite\\n(mechanics). Electronic boards, at least one for each of the subsystems are used to\\ndi\\x0buse orders as well as to gather telemetry, Fig 5.2-a. In order to coordinate satel-\\nlite operations, a hierarchical planning system based on the the Autonomous Robot\\nArchitecture (AuRA) [Ark87] concept has been adopted.

In order to evaluate the\\nperformances of the spacecraft, a study conducted over the subsystems one by one\\nwould lack in consistency; this is because subsystems and components conditions\\ncould change over time even when a speci\\x0cc element is not active. As important as\\nthe subsystem models, the cross-connections among them need to be considered. In\\nsome cases these induced variations could be foreseen and controlled in order to keep\\nthem within an acceptable range (as its done for the thermal control). Other -i.e.\\nsatellite mass and inertia variations due to fuel consumption- can be addressed by\\nmodifying the parameters in the control system -ADCS gains-. Things start to get\\ncomplicated when the distance between the source of the variation(s) and the mea-\\nsurable e\\x0bects spread over more than one subsystem or to components non directly\\ninvolved in the original chain of events. This may be the case of the activation of the\\npayload, commanded by the on-board computer: the operation requires both EPS\\nand OBDH resources, whose exploit introduces additional loads for the involved dis-\\ntribution board and (possibly) batteries. The dissipated energy generates heat \\ruxes\\nthat could a\\x0bect batteries or solar panel (as well as other components) e\\x0eciency. The\\nconsequences of the payload activation also depend on satellite attitude and con\\x0cgu-\\nration. A simpli\\x0ced scheme of the modelled connections and relationships is shown in\\nFig. 5.2-b (some connections are not shown for clarity). Another aspect worth to be68 Single Spacecraft Operation\\n(a)\\n (b)\\nFigure 5.2: Propagation of information through di\\x0berent layers (a) and connections among\\nsubsystems (b)\\nmentioned is that most of the operations need a variable number of pre-conditions,\\nusually related to several subsystems. Than, in order to check if the spacecraft is able\\nto perform a speci\\x0ced task, the status of the whole vehicle should be tested. Among\\nthe available integrated simulation tools, just a few are designed to evaluate the side-\\ne\\x0bects between di\\x0berent subsystems and none of them is speci\\x0ccally addressed to\\nmultiple satellites; this lead to the decision to develop a new tool with both single\\nand cooperative spacecraft operation capacity.\\n5.1 Environment\\nAs modelled satellites are dedicated to Earth observation, an environmental model of\\nthe low and mid Earth orbits have been integrated within the simulation tool in order\\nto evaluate attitude and orbit disturbances as well as thermal conditions.

Special perturbations method has been\\nused to evaluate the e\\x0bect of the disturbances and control actions on orbit evolution,\\nas although they are the simplest and the most straightforward of the perturbation\\nmethods, they also produce accurate results [VAl04]. Implemented orbital model has\\nbeen compared with STK software achieving comparable results, Fig 5.3. On a 3 days\\nsimulation the di\\x0berence between the implemented propagator and the SGP4 model is\\nin the order of 40 meters, accurate enough for the tasks demanded to the simulator.\\nIn order to ensure orbital changes as well as maintenance, algorithms for orbital\\n(a)\\n0.5 11.5 22.5 33.5 44.5 5\\nx 105−30−20−100102030Difference [m]\\nTime [s] (b)\\nFigure 5.3: Orbit propagation\\ncontrol have been implemented; as for the attitude control, Lyapunov energy-based\\ncontrol functions have been used [SJ03]. The response to a two impulse manoeuvre\\nperformed to change the initial orbit has been reported, using both di\\x0berences between\\ncurrent and reference orbits, Fig. 5.4-a and total distance 5.4-b. The presence of the\\npropulsion system with enough propellant is mandatory in order to execute this kind\\nof manners. The attitude control will provide for the satellite pointing in the required\\ndirection during the thrust phases.\\n5.2 Spacecraft Subsystems\\nIn the broadest sense the satellite itself is only an element within a larger system that\\nincludes the ground support and the launcher, but so far the focus has been kept on\\nthe spacecraft.\\n5.2.1 Payload\\nAlthough technically not a subsystem, is the fundamental reason the spacecraft is\\n\\rown.

Payloads are commanded by the C&DH and activated\\nwhen pre-conditions (duty cycle, available power, lightning conditions) are satis\\x0ced.\\n5.2.2 Electrical Power System\\nThe EPS has the function to provide, store, distribute and control the electrical power\\nwithin the spacecraft.

The sharp variations\\nin produced power are due to periodical eclipses.\\n5.2.3 Thermal\\nThe control of the temperature of the spacecraft equipment and structural elements is\\nrequired for two reasons [FSS11]: most of electronic and mechanical parts are designed\\nto work e\\x0eciently within a narrow temperature range and materials typically have a\\nnon-zero thermal expansion coe\\x0ecient thus meaning that a temperature change would\\nintroduce a thermal distortion. Active or purely passive controls can be used, as well\\nas combination of them. The spacecraft has been represented using a lumped system\\nanalysis [IDBL07]; the satellite is reduced to a network of discrete spots connected\\nby thermal resistances (conductive and radiative). In fact by applying the principle\\nof the conservation of energy to every node of the system:\\nQin\\x00Qout= \\x01Qstored (5.1)72 Single Spacecraft Operation\\n(a)\\n0123456789\\nx 104280285290295300305310315320\\nTime [s]Temperature [K]\\n  \\nMain struct\\nPanel supp2\\nPanel supp4\\nPanel supp5\\nPanel supp6\\nSolar panel\\nLGA\\nPayload\\nPCU\\nBattery\\nDH board\\nTT&C board\\nADCS board\\nMT1\\nMT2\\nMT3 (b)\\nFigure 5.6: Thermal network\\nwhere QinandQoutare the inward and outward heat \\rux respectively, Qstored is the\\namount of stored power, and considering both Fourier\\'s law, (Eq. 5.2) and Stefan-\\nBoltzmann\\'s law for a gray body (Eq. 5.3), system can be written as Eq. 5.4 for\\ni; j= 1 : n[IDBL07].\\nQ=\\x00K A\\x01T (5.2)\\nQ=\\x1b \\x0b \\x0f F A \\x01T4(5.3)\\nX\\ni6=jKij(Tj\\x00Ti) +X\\ni6=jRij\\x00\\nT4\\nj\\x00T4\\ni\\x01\\n+Qi=CidTi\\ndt(5.4)\\nKijrepresents the thermal resistance (conductive) between nodes iandj,Rijthe\\nradiative resistance and Cithe heat capacity of node i.

In order to achieve this goal, two main tasks have to be performed: at-\\ntitude determination using sensors -and status estimators- and control [LW99]. Cur-\\nrently, sensors are included in the mass and power budgets but they do not have\\na mathematical model within the ADS abstraction i.e. attitude, position and ve-\\nlocity are known and error-free. The complete spacecraft dynamics is calculated by\\nintegration of the Newton-Euler equations [Wie08]. Control torques determination is\\nachieved thanks to Lyapunov Control Functions [SJ03]; this technique has been cho-\\nsen over a more conventional Proportional Integral Derivative control to better assess\\nvariations in the dynamical model and guarantee an higher controllability in case\\nof manoeuvres involving large angles [BLH01]. Control torques are then processed\\naccording to the class of used actuators in order to calculate required power and -if\\nneeded- propellant to perform the manoeuvre. Maximum and minimum applicable\\ntorques are self-computed given the features of the control devices, their position\\nwithin the spacecraft and the orbital parameters (as magneto-torquers are in\\ruenced74 Single Spacecraft Operation\\nby the Earth\\'s magnetic \\x0celd).\\n5.2.5 On Board Data Handling\\nThe C&DH receives, validates, decodes, and distributes commands to the subsystems\\nand at the same time gathers, processes, and formats satellite housekeeping and mis-\\nsion data for down-link or use by an on board computer. In order to manage the\\nsatellite, at least a simple control architecture has to been implemented; it has to\\nful\\x0cl several objectives [SMR]:\\n/x88Programmability: satellites cannot be designed for only one precise task. They\\nshould be able to achieve multiple tasks which should be described at some\\nabstraction level. The functions should be easily combined according to the\\ntask to be executed.\\n/x88Reactivity: spacecraft should be able to take into account external events with\\ntime bounds that are compatible with the correct and e\\x0ecient execution of their\\ntask (including their own safety).\\n/x88Autonomy and adaptivity: satellites are designed to accomplish their task by\\nthemselves despite of possibly changing external circumstances.\\n/x88Robustness: the control architecture should be able to exploit the redundancy\\nof the processing functions (for example by decentralising all parts of the control\\nsystem that does not explicitly require centralisation).\\n/x88Coherent behaviour: to achieve the main task, reactions of the spacecraft to\\nexternal stimuli must be guided by the objectives of the task.\\n/x88Observability: to be controllable at higher level, the functional level should\\nmake accessible a representation of its activity and data concerning the state of\\nthe rover or information about its environment.\\nIn order to achieve these purposes a hybrid deliberative/reactive robotic architecture\\nthat was developed in the mid-1980\\'s and known as AuRA has been integrated with\\nthe simulated OBDH. The original code [Ark87] was a hybrid approach to robotic\\nnavigation. Hybridisation arises from the presence of two distinct components: a\\ndeliberative or hierarchical planner, based on traditional arti\\x0ccial intelligence tech-\\nniques; and a reactive controller, based upon schema theory [FC94]. A hybrid system\\nmust combine the two time-scales and representations of the deliberative and reactive\\narchitectures in an e\\x0bective way. Usually, a middle layer is required. Its mission is to\\nachieve the right compromise between the two ends. Consequently hybrid systems are\\noften called Three-layer-architectures . The highest level is concerned with establish-\\ning high level goals; in this case it has been simulated by loading a sequence of tasks\\n(equivalent to send instructions to the spacecraft from the control centre). Issued\\ncommands are stored and executed when pre-conditions are met, e.g. downlinks can\\nbe established only when a communication window is open. The main instructions are5.2 Spacecraft Subsystems 75\\nthen broken down into sub-tasks and distributed among the relative subsystems where\\nelectronic boards are responsible for their control and execution. The implemented\\nconcept connects two distinct AI paradigms, deliberation and reactivity; the advan-\\ntages of this strategy have been demonstrated in several other hybrid architectures\\nthat have subsequently appeared [GKBM98]. The disadvantages of this architecture\\narise from the presence of di\\x0berent modules: it inherits the drawbacks on the sin-\\ngle modules plus the complexity of the creation of an harmonic link between them\\n[KS03]. Although old-fashioned, the used three layers architecture has been selected\\nconsidering its straightforward implementation and simplicity compared with modern\\n(more capable but also more complicated) approaches. Apart from the management\\nof the spacecraft, the DH also has to access, retrieve and store science and telemetry\\ninformation. The adopted model for these functions is extremely simple, basically a\\nconservation equation: data movements cause variation in the used memory as they\\ncome to (routed from instruments, communication receivers or components teleme-\\ntry) or they leave the satellite (download to Earth or another spacecraft), Fig. 5.8.\\nAt the same time, the absorbed power by the involved components is updated.\\nStructureStructure\\nThermalThermal\\nEPSEPSPropulsionPropulsion\\nADCSADCSOBDHOBDH\\nTT&CTT&CPLPLSensorSensor\\nCPUCPU\\nMemoryMemory\\nencodingencoding\\nantennaantennaSatellite 1\\nStructureStructure\\nThermalThermal\\nEPSEPSPropulsionPropulsion\\nADCSADCSOBDHOBDH\\nTT&CTT&CPLPL\\nCPUCPU\\nMemoryMemory\\ndecodingdecoding\\nantennaantenna\\nSatellite 2\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x07\\x04\\nAvailable resources\\nAvailable actionsAgent 1\\n\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x07\\x04\\nAvailable resources\\nAvailable actionsAgent 2\\nFigure 5.8: Data transfer among 2 satellites\\n5.2.6 Telecommunications\\nThe TT&C has not a model in the mathematical sense; it works as a bridge between\\nthe simulated ground stations (or satellites) and is responsible for the evaluation of the\\nincoming (or outgoing) datarate.

The activation of the attitude or orbital engines causes heat dis-\\nsipation, absorption of electric power and a reduction of the remaining propellant\\nmass. Once again, a conservation equation holds the model of the subsystem. Fuel\\nconsumption is evaluated according to thrusters speci\\x0cc impulse, mass ratio and dura-\\ntion of the activation. Mass, inertia and pressure of the propellant inside the tank(s)\\nis updated at each time-step. Thruster model is simpli\\x0ced, and upon activation the\\nmaximum thrust is applied without transient phase.CHAPTER 6\\nSpacecraft System Operation\\nAt the state of the art, only communication-type inter-satellites connections have been\\nmodelled: even if the adopted management system could be also extended to power\\ntransmission, it is an option that is always discarded during design optimisation, thus\\nits implementation has been postponed. The NASA\\'s TDRS is an example of working\\nsatellites connection system; from a general point of view it is not di\\x0berent from\\nthe concept of spacecraft-ground station communication, the main di\\x0berence that\\nlies in the fact that the TDRSS elements are moving to. Communications between\\nsatellites has several advantages [CGG13], mainly related to the low -compared with\\nthe atmospheric propagation- free space losses that allows smaller, lighter and less\\npower demanding systems. Nonetheless within the spacecraft system, at least one\\nelement with a traditional high gain antenna is still required.\\n6.1 Game Theory-Based Satellite Communications\\nA game theory-based control of the data sharing among satellites, partially based on\\n[FHB06] has been implemented. Each node (satellite) is connected to one or more\\nof the surrounding nodes; the connectivity is represented by means of a directional\\ngraph, Fig. 6.1-a. Single hop connections allow communications between node iand\\ni+ 1 lying on the same path. Communication between non-neighbouring nodes is\\nbased on multi-hop relaying, thus forcing the source node to rely on intermediate\\nnodes to deliver his data to the end node. The list of nodes (vertex of the graph) and\\nlinks that connect source and destination form a path; the time required to deliver an\\ninformation package (or fraction of it) depends on the connectivity graph (assuming78 Spacecraft System Operation\\nintermediate nodes cooperation). Data packages are assumed to be divisible; if a\\nsingle node is shared among several paths the throughput will be equally divided\\namong the outgoing routes, Fig. 6.1-b (e.g. node 7 generates 5 units of tra\\x0ec that are\\nrouted through 2 paths, 2.5 units each). Packages symbolise output from scienti\\x0cc\\ninstruments, telemetry and commands that have to be transferred to and from a\\nsatellite able to communicate with the ground station (thus acting as comms hub).\\n12\\n10543\\n946\\n3\\n13\\n24\\n8125\\n76\\n(a)\\n012 3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7 890 1 0 001000100\\n0100\\n0100\\n012.50\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n−5\\n1\\n5\\n00\\n1\\n2.5\\n00\\n1\\n0\\n00\\n2.500 0\\n00\\n2.500 (b)\\nFigure 6.1: Randomly generated Networks (The information placed radially with respect\\nto a node are ID, payo\\x0b, cooperation, throughput and used memory)\\n6.1.1 Forwarding Game\\nThe operation of the network has been modelled as a game, whose structure is similar\\nto the forwarder dilemma [Mye97]; each node must pay (representation of power con-\\nsumed by the TT&C) in order to send the package along the path but only the source\\nreceives a reward for having his own data delivered. So the players (the nodes) at\\neach time-step tchoose a cooperation level pi(t)2[0;1]; 1 represents full cooperation,\\nmeaning that all the received packages are forwarded whereas 0 is associated to full\\ndefection (no data are forwarded). Thus, pi(t) represents the fraction of the tra\\x0ec\\nrouted through iintthat iactually forwards. Non-forwarding has been considered\\nas the only reason that could lead to data loss (i.e. no network congestion, power or\\ndata rate limits etc.). Later on, modi\\x0ccations on pi(t) meaning and values will be\\nintroduced. In order to simplify the model, the same level of cooperation is applied\\nfrom node ito every paths it is linked to. The generic route rconnects the source\\nsand destination nodes through f1;f2;\\x01\\x01\\x01;flthe intermediate points. Ts(r) is the\\ntra\\x0ec that swants to send on rin each time-step. The throughput \\x1c(r; t) experi-\\nenced by the source sonrintis de\\x0cned as the fraction of the tra\\x0ec sent by sonr\\nintthat is e\\x0bectively delivered to the destination. Hence, \\x1c(r; t) can be computed as\\nthe product of Ts(r; t) and the cooperation levels of all intermediate nodes (with no6.1 Game Theory-Based Satellite Communications 79\\nre-routed packages):\\n\\x1c(r; t) =Ts(r)\\x01lY\\nk=1pfk(t) (6.1)\\nRe-routing can happen when multiple paths have access to the same nodes in a\\ndi\\x0berent sequence. In the original paper [FHB06], a normalised form of the throughput\\nhas been de\\x0cned and used as input for the evaluation of the strategy; due to the\\nintroduction of the shared nodes and the subsequent data division among several\\npaths, that approach has been dropped and the e\\x0bective throughput has been adopted\\nin order to evaluate with an higher \\x0cdelity costs and gains. The Payo\\x0b (PO) \\x18s(r; t)\\nofsonrintdepends on the experienced throughput \\x1c(r; t). The payo\\x0b \\x11fj(r; t) of\\nthej-th intermediate node fjonrintis non-positive and represents the cost for\\nnode fjto forward packets on route rduring time step t. It is de\\x0cned as:\\n\\x11fj(r; t) =\\x00cf\\x01\\x1cj(r; t) (6.2)\\n\\x1cj(r; t) is the amount of tra\\x0ec that is passing through node j(in the original statement\\nthe normalised throughput has been used). If a single node is shared among Njpaths,\\nits total forward cost is given by the sum of the packages send over the di\\x0ber paths:\\n\\x11fj(t) =NjX\\nk=1\\x00cf\\x01\\x1cj(k; t) (6.3)\\ncfdepicts the power consumed by the satellite to forward one unit of tra\\x0ec (either\\ngenerated by the spacecraft itself or relayed). An introduced, although unsophisti-\\ncated hypothesis, is that the transmission cost is the same for all nodes, regardless for\\nthe distance between them, and constant over time; this is based on the assumption\\nthat inter-satellite distance is controlled and with regulated range variations (thus\\nleading to nearly constant free-space losses). Using this approach, the payo\\x0b of the\\ndestination node is equal to zero, due to the fact that only the nodes that generate\\nthe data \\row bene\\x0ct if the their packages are delivered. The total payo\\x0b \\x19i(t) of\\nnode iin time slot tis computed as the sum of internal ( \\x18(r; t)) and external ( \\x11(r; t))\\npayo\\x0bs.\\n\\x19i(t) =X\\nq2Si(t)\\x18i(q; t) +X\\nr2Fi(t)\\x11i(r; t) (6.4)\\nThe method used to evaluate the payo\\x0b causes the game to be slightly di\\x0berent\\nfrom the classical forwarder\\'s dilemma [Mye97] but leads to the same result, the only\\nNash Equilibrium (NE) of the game is the non-cooperation of the nodes. This is\\nrelated to the initial statement that only source nodes can expect a payo\\x0b larger\\nthan zero, whereas all the others will relay information (thus consuming their own\\nresources) to gain nothing. Assuming a single package, payo\\x0b \\x11fj(r; t) and cost c\\ntake the values of 1 and cfrespectively.

The \\x0cnal result is that no packages will be delivered. Several\\nsolutions to incentive nodes cooperation has been proposed, either by denying service\\nto misbehaving nodes through a reputation mechanism, increasing the payo\\x0b of the\\naltruist players or introducing penalties related to lost packages.\\nThe time required to forward the data from source to destination along a path is\\ngreater than a single simulation step; this has a non negligible e\\x0bect on the chosen\\ncooperation level of the nodes, introducing a delay between the change in strategy\\nand the variation in terms of expected payo\\x0b. In particular, even starting from\\na nominal condition with full cooperating nodes the payo\\x0b is negative for all the\\nelements (including the source), due to the fact that no packages are reaching the\\ndestination as they are still en route. Then without any incentive strategy-evaluations\\nbased on the payo\\x0b at the last time-step will result in the stop of the data forwarding.\\n6.1.2 Memory and Storage Cost\\nIn the conventional form of the game, non-forwarded packages are lost. Considering\\nthat the packages typically represent valuable data, this is non-desirable, and the\\nexploit of the on-board memory to store a limited amount of information has been\\nintroduced; non-forwarded packages are progressively recorded up to the maximum\\nallowed. Related to the memory capacity, a cost for data storage has been added,\\ncs, proportional to the percentage of use. The insertion of the memory naturally\\nresults in a penalty for non-cooperating spacecraft; as the node does not forward the\\npackages it has to pay an increasingly larger price for their storage, up to the point\\nwhere the data transmission is preferable. The intermediate node payo\\x0b function has\\nbeen modi\\x0ced accordingly, for non-shared node:\\n\\x11fj(r; t) =\\x00cf\\x01\\x1cj(r; t)\\x00cs\\x01memory used j (6.5)6.1 Game Theory-Based Satellite Communications 81\\nAnd consequently for multiple-paths nodes:\\n\\x11fj(t) =NjX\\nk=1(\\x00cf\\x01\\x1cj(k; t))\\x00cs\\x01memory used j (6.6)\\nIn order to represent an incentive to data transmission, storage cost must be scaled\\nconsidering to available memory, expected node throughput and forward cost.

This problem is exacerbated for fractionated satellites, both\\ndue to the enlarged number of design variables and due to their mutual in\\ruence\\non di\\x0berent satellites. As a result, the \\x0cnal design could be ine\\x0ecient, leaving room\\nfor improvements in performance and reductions in lifecycle cost. Thus, a method is\\nneeded to enable a greater search of the trade space and explore design options that\\nmight not otherwise be considered during the conceptual design phase. Optimisation\\nis one such method: by de\\x0cnition it is the process of achieving the most favourable\\nsystem condition on the basis of a metric or set of metrics [boo98]. Within the past\\nsixty years, di\\x0berent optimisation techniques have been applied to numerous complex\\nproblems, ranging from the design of airline \\right networks that maximise revenues\\n[SSL99] under scheduling constraints [Mat97] to the allocation of assets in \\x0cnancial\\nportfolios [Ste99] under capital, regulatory, and risk constraints.\\nIn its pure de\\x0cnition, optimisation refers to \\x0cnding the absolute best solution to a\\nproblem. However from an engineering point of view this could be hardly achievable:\\ndue to the dimension of the search space, the non-linearities in the design process and\\nthe combinations of continuous and discrete variables, conceptual design often results\\nin NP-hard problems, thus requiring considerable resources in order to be completely\\nsolved. Furthermore design problems tend to be combinatorial in nature with discrete\\nvariables having nonlinear relationships, so classical optimisation techniques that re-\\nquire continuously di\\x0berentiable convex functions, like the simplex method, gradient\\ndescent and quasi-newton methods, cannot be used. Instead, particle (or agent) based\\nmethods does not require the optimisation problem to be di\\x0berentiable therefore they92 Optimisation\\nare suitable to be used on optimisation problems that are partially irregular, noisy or\\nchange over time [PKB07].\\n7.1 Particle Swarm Optimisation\\n7.1.1 Informal description\\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was \\x0crst introduced by Dr. Russell C. Eberhart\\nand Dr. James Kennedy in 1995 [KE95]; their work was essentially aimed at produc-\\ning computational intelligence by exploiting simple analogues of social interaction,\\nrather than purely individual cognitive abilities. As originally described, the PSO\\nAlgorithm is an adaptive algorithm based on a social-psychological metaphor; a popu-\\nlation of individuals (referred to as particles) adapts by returning stochastically toward\\npreviously successful regions [KE01]. The PSO Algorithm shares similar characteris-\\ntics to Genetic Algorithm, however, the manner in which the two algorithms traverse\\nthe search space Eis fundamentally di\\x0berent. Eis a hyperparallelepid de\\x0cned as the\\nEuclidean product of Dreal intervals:\\nE=DO\\nd=1[min d; max d] (7.1)\\nIn order to perform a search, PSO makes use of agents called particles , which move\\nat every step ( iteration ). The set of Sparticles is called the swarm . The swarm\\ntopology de\\x0cnes how particles are connected, thus controlling information sharing;\\nwhen a particle is informed by another one, it becomes aware of the previous best\\n(position and \\x0ctness) of the informing particle. Directly connected particles are called\\nneighbours .

One parameter is the size Sof the population (often set empirically on the basis\\nof the dimensionality and perceived di\\x0eculty of a problem, commonly ranging between\\n20 and 50 [SE98]). The parameters \\x1e1and\\x1e2control the magnitude of the random\\nforces in the direction of personal and neighbourhood best piandpg(acceleration\\ncoe\\x0ecients).

Changing \\x1e1and\\x1e2can make the PSO more or94 Optimisation\\nless responsive and consequently less or more stable, with particle speeds increasing\\nwithout control. Speed control was initially achieved by hard-bounding velocities so\\nthat each component of viis kept within a given range [ \\x06Vmax]. The optimal value of\\nVmaxis problem-speci\\x0cc, but no reasonable rule of thumb is known and furthermore it\\nin\\ruences the balance between exploration and exploitation. Successive versions of the\\nPSO (inertia weight, constriction coe\\x0ecients) have addressed the problem [PKB07].\\nThe choice for neighbourhood topology determines which individual to use for pg.\\nSeveral topologies have been applied to PSO:\\n/x88proximity in the search space (Euclidean neighbourhood)\\n/x88gbestthe best neighbour in the entire population in\\ruences the target particle\\n(can be conceptualised as a fully connected graph); it converges fast, as all the\\nparticles are attracted simultaneously to the best part of the E. The drawback\\nis that if the global optimum is not close to the best particle found so far, swarm\\nexploration toward other areas will be limited: the swarm can be trapped in\\nlocal optima.\\n/x88lbestparticle is a\\x0bected by a restricted number of other particles; this topology\\nhad the advantage of allowing parallel search, as sub-populations could converge\\nin diverse regions of E. The swarm will converge slower but can locate the global\\noptimum with a greater chance.\\nAs the lbesttopology seemed better for exploring the search space while gbestconverged\\nfaster, a wide range of adaptive topologies (that begin the search with an lbestlattice\\nand increase the size of the neighbourhood, thus achieving fully connected population\\nby the end of the run) have been developed [Sug99].\\nDi\\x0berent neighbourhoods can be characterised in terms of two factors: the degree of\\nconnectivity, K, that measures the number of neighbours of a particle and the amount\\nof clustering C, that measures the number of neighbours of a particle that are also\\nneighbours of each other.\\n7.2 Design Parameters\\nIn order to work and \\x0cnd a solution within acceptable time constrains, PSO internal\\nparameters as well as design variables (fractions) have to be coherently set and used.\\n7.2.1 PSO Parameters\\nSwarm size and neighbourhood topology have been chosen after a series of test runs,\\nin order to evaluate whose parameters where more e\\x0bective in solving the distribute\\ndesign optimisation.

In order to be used within the\\nPSO algorithm, fractions have to be translated into range information: minimum and\\nmaximum allowable values will constitute the upper and lower boundaries of the state\\nvector that is base that allows the algorithm to seed new particles. For simplicity frac-\\ntionation has been expressed using values in the range \\x061 referred to the \\\\main\" or\\n\\x0crst satellite in the cluster:\\n/x88positive values indicate that the main satellite covers a master position (provides\\na remote resource, e.g. is the comms hub or the power beaming source).\\n/x88negative values are associated to dependant roles (the main spacecraft exploits\\nresources shared by the other elements in the cluster).\\nFor coherence, the other modules in the spacecraft system hold the opposite role with\\na reduced e\\x0bectiveness, such that the sum of the parameters for a speci\\x0cc subsystem\\nover the cluster is equal to zero. Fraction parameters are then mapped into minimum-\\nmaximum values to describe the amount, and not only the percentage, of resources\\nthat have to be allocated, Tab 7.1.

This con\\x0crms the output of the single parameter optimisations.\\n/x88The PSO requires a small number of iterations to reach a candidate solution;\\nhowever the non-linearities highlighted during the DH and TT&C analysis ob-\\nstacle the convergence thus causing the algorithm to perform additional steps,\\nchanging the parameters without achieving improvements to the \\x0ctness function.\\nThe heuristic solution to address the problem could involve the modi\\x0ccation of\\nthe convergence condition to prevent further evaluations when multiple parti-\\ncles achieve the same \\x0ctness in spite of di\\x0berent state vectors. Nonetheless a\\nsimilar approach would cause the PSO to be entrapped by local minima [SE98].\\nA minimum of 3 populations with the same best \\x0ctness has been used as min-\\nimum requirement in order to stop the optimisation (value estimated from the\\nobservation of the DH and TT&C graphs).\\n/x88DH and TT&C fractions combined achieve a marginally better \\x0ctness value\\nthan non-fractioned spacecraft systems given the same number of elements; the\\ndi\\x0berence is so negligible that the mentioned development costs for the sharing\\nsystem are likely to frustrate the obtained advantage.\\n/x88Monolithic con\\x0cguration could \\x0ct in a medium class launcher (in this case, the\\nDeltaII-7400 was selected), whereas multiple modules require a larger rocket110 Conclusions\\nmainly due to fairing dimension requirements (as the Atlas V-521); this alone\\nintroduces a nearly 40 M AC cost di\\x0berence.\\nThe traditional con\\x0cguration is, with a certain margin, the optimal solution when\\ncosts are used to evaluate the performances. According to literature, [BLSE07, MW06]\\nfractioned satellite cost over lifecycle should be on average lower than an equivalent\\nmonolithic system when failures (both satellites and launchers) are considered. Those\\nevents would result in the necessity to replace the satellite and an approach aimed to\\ndivide the spacecraft among smaller elements would facilitate the process. However\\nthose calculations have been made in 2004; the current trend in launchers reliability\\nis largely positive (3 accidents over 81 launches in 2013 [Spab]) and the chances for a\\nlaunch failure are now considerably lower [SA98, GPC05].\\nAnother motivation related to the exploit of the fractioned architecture is that small,\\nstandard platforms would reduce development time and costs. But, under the pres-\\nsure of the increasingly capable CubeSats, this is already happening and almost every\\nsatellite-producer has engineered versatile small to medium size standard satellites\\nthat could be rapidly integrated with customer-provided payloads.\\nMoreover the drop out of the F6 project due to, among the others, the lack of pro-\\ngresses in the secure networking in Space introduces the legitimate suspect that the\\nresearch for a Space-quali\\x0ced application of remote computing is quite far from being\\ntrivial or just a reverse-engineering of terrestrial applications.\\nAnd \\x0cnally the functional decoupling raises more problems than it can solve. The\\nmain idea, divide payload requirements from \\\\service\" requirements, has to face the\\ncurrent technology. The problems encountered with the proposed EPS have been:\\n/x88Low e\\x0eciency of the available technologies; both energy producer and energy-\\nfuelled spacecraft su\\x0bered mass and cost penalties caused by the extended solar\\narrays, advanced power distribution units, enhanced thermal control system.\\n/x88The module with the payload still has to obey requirements imposed by the\\nEPS: solar cells on the Sun-facing panels have been replaced with monochrome,\\nmaster-satellite aimed cells (or even worse a hemispherical radome to collect\\nmicrowaves).\\n/x88Con\\x0cguration issues introduced by the necessity to have both traditional com-\\nponents to ensure survival in case of master satellite failure and power-beam\\ndedicated elements.\\nSimilarly, the proposed fractioned attitude determination has come to naught due to\\nsensor improvements and miniaturisation; the complications related to the exploit of\\nvisual (equivalently LIDAR or radio-frequency) sensors to evaluate the attitude of an-\\nother spacecraft could be justi\\x0ced when a docking manoeuvre with a non-collaborating\\nvehicle is attempted, whereas using it as standard way to evaluate the relative orien-\\ntation it does not allow neither an accuracy improvement nor a signi\\x0ccant cost/mass8.1 Open points and Further developments 111\\nreduction. Furthermore the system is not fail-safe unless a mean to ensure indepen-\\ndent, absolute attitude determination is ensured also for slave elements (enduring\\na reduced accuracy). Alternatively the remote attitude determination could be a\\nfeasible solution when a single \\\\main\" satellite is also responsible for the control of\\na swarm (tens or more)of proximity \\rying nano satellites, each too small to host a\\ncomplete sensor suite by its own; however the marketing of CubeSat-aimed complete\\nADCS platform with integrated nano star tracker [BCT13, PSH13] might have \\x0clled\\nthe niche where remote ADS could have been employed.\\nOn the opposite, remote communication and data handling could result in favourable\\ncon\\x0cgurations. As already mentioned the concept is not too di\\x0berent from the TDRS,\\nalthough reduced to a smaller scale and with limited range capability. When applied\\nto distributed satellites, they allow a limited improvements on the total cost; satel-\\nlite to satellite communications have already been used, although the missing step is\\nthe technology required to establish an -at least semi-autonomous- network able to\\nensure safe and reliable data exchange. A minimum of redundancy has been intro-\\nduced, imposing the slave satellites to be able to receive commands and download\\ntheir telemetry even in case of main satellite malfunction. Nevertheless also satellites\\ncommunication are changing: thanks to US and European data relay networks, new\\nspacecraft have unparalleled downlink capacity thanks to the possibility to take advan-\\ntage of longer contact windows towards geostationary satellites exploiting extremely\\nhigh datarate (exceeding 1 Gbps) laser systems [EIW+12]. This evolution would re-\\nduce the need for locally-fractioned satellites, as bridges based on \\\\standard\" data\\nrelay would provide access to higher grade performances, unless the fractioned system\\nitself is equipped with a comparable system. The potential advantageous applications\\nof TT&C/DH sharing are restricted to spacecraft systems that, due to technical or\\nscienti\\x0cc purposes, are forcedly composed by more than one satellites. In that case,\\nthe concentration of the communication equipment on a single element, instead of its\\nduplication on both modules allow for a reduction of the mass, cost and complexity\\nof the resulting system.\\n8.1 Open points and Further developments\\nAll of the made analysis are based on cost models that have been only partially in-\\ndependently veri\\x0ced; the expenses for research and development have been evaluated\\nusing CERs that have been tailored on conventional satellites. Furthermore, even\\nwhen used within their range of applicability, CERs accuracy could be a\\x0bected by\\nmistakes, especially for new design spacecraft. Thus is possible that recurrent cost\\nmistakes have been propagated since the beginning of this research. Both monolithic\\nand fractioned spacecraft could have been a\\x0bected. However there are no reasons to\\nbelieve that (apart from the additional development cost due to still to implement net-\\nworking) the errors should a\\x0bect di\\x0berently the two con\\x0cgurations: if there are faults112 Conclusions\\nthey should produce similar e\\x0bects in both cases. To this end, percentage variations\\nhave been calculated. And the test reported in Sec. 7.5 shows such large di\\x0berences\\nthat even introducing inaccuracies is still unlikely that the fractioned con\\x0cguration\\ncould win the direct comparison with the traditional approach. Similarly the costs\\nassociated to monolithic and multiple satellites con\\x0cgurations show considerable dif-\\nferences and only the results dictated by the distributed vs distributed-and-fractioned\\ncontrast could show a di\\x0berent outcome (shift in balance). Apart from a veri\\x0ccation\\nwith another cost model, other open points that could be considered:\\n/x88Investigate if (substantial) improvements in power beaming technology could\\nmade fractioned EPS technically and economically attractive.\\n/x88Evaluate if smaller satellites would have any bene\\x0ct from the fractioned archi-\\ntecture (the use of the PSO in this case has been postponed due to the poor\\nperformances of fractioned satellites when the original dry mass is less 1000 kg,\\nas highlighted in Chap. 4).\\n/x88Introduce during cost evaluation the failure probability, thus retracing the spec-\\nulations that originally suggested the potential bene\\x0ct of the fractioned concept.\\n/x88Improve the \\rexibility and the reliability of the satellite design tool, as intro-\\nduced in Sec. 3.4.\\n/x88Add further alternatives to used fractioned-related hardware like communication\\nlasers instead of patch antennas.\\n/x88Implement more sophisticated control schemes both to manage the single satel-\\nlite, as well as to coordinate the e\\x0borts of the complete spacecraft system.Bibliography\\n[ADL98] J.

The goal is to monitor the complex interac-\\ntions of atmospheric constituents from both natural sources, such as biological activity\\nand volcanoes, and man-made sources, such as biomass burning, are contributing to\\nglobal change and e\\x0bect the creation and depletion of ozone. The Aura mission will\\nprovide global surveys of several atmospheric constituents. Temperature, geopotential\\nheights, and aerosol \\x0celds will also be mapped. In many ways, Aura is a follow-on to\\nthe very successful UARS (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite) mission of NASA,\\nactive from 1991 to 2005. Unlike UARS, however, Aura is designed to focus on the\\nlower stratosphere and the troposphere. Aura \\ries in formation about 15 minutes be-\\nhind Aqua in the \"A-Train\" satellite constellation which consists of several satellites\\n\\rying in close proximity. Each individual mission has its own science objectives; all\\nwill improve our understanding of aspects of the Earth\\'s climate. The synergism that\\nis expected to be gained by \\rying in close proximity to each other should enable the\\noverall science results of the Afternoon Constellation to be greater than the sum of\\nthe science of each individual mission.\\nSpacecraft\\nThe Aura spacecraft, like Aqua, is based on TRW\\'s (now Northrop Grumman Space\\nTechnology) modular, standardized AB1200 bus design with common subsystems.\\nThe S/C dimensions are: 2.68 m x 2.34 m x 6.85 m (stowed) and 4.71 m x 17.03 m\\nx 6.85 m (deployed).\\nAura is three-axis stabilized, with a total mass at launch of 2,967 kg, 1,200 kg of\\nwhich are scienti\\x0cc instruments.126 Aura Mission\\nThe S/C design life is six years. The spacecraft structure is a lightweight \\'egg-crate\\'\\n(a)\\n (b)\\nFigure 1: Artist\\'s rendering of Aura in orbit (a) and payloads disposition (b)\\ncompartment construction made of graphite epoxy composite over honeycomb core,\\nproviding a strong but light base for the science instruments, Fig 1-a. The weight\\nof the structure is approximately 700 kg. A single, deployable, 15 m long, \\rat-panel\\nsolar array with over 20.000 silicon solar cells provides 4.6 kW of power; 24 cell nickel-\\nhydrogen battery powers the spacecraft and the instruments during the night phase of\\nthe orbit. Spacecraft attitude is maintained by stellar-inertial, and momentum wheel-\\nbased attitude controls with magnetic momentum unloading, through interaction with\\nthe magnetic \\x0celd of the Earth that provide accurate pointing for the instruments.\\nTypical pointing knowledge of the line of sight of the instruments to the Earth is on\\nthe order of one arc-minute (about 0.02\\x0e). A propulsion system of four small-thrust\\nhydrazine mono-propellant thrusters gives the spacecraft a capability to adjust its\\norbit periodically to compensate for the e\\x0bects of atmospheric drag, so that the orbit\\ncan be precisely controlled to maintain altitude and the assigned ground track.\\nElectronic components are housed on panels internally, leaving the spacecraft \\'deck\\'\\navailable for the four science instruments, and providing them a wide \\x0celd of view. The\\nside of the spacecraft away from the Sun is devoted to thermal radiators, which radiate\\nexcess heat to space and provide the proper thermal balance for the entire spacecraft.\\nThe satellite has been launched using a Delta-2 7920 vehicle from VAFB, CA, on July\\n15, 2004 to the designed orbit, a Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude 705 km,\\ninclination 98.7\\x0e, with a local equator crossing time of 13:45 on the ascending node.\\nRepeat cycle of 16 days. Onboard storage capacity of 100 Gbit of payload data. The\\npayload data are downlinked in X-band. The spacecraft can also broadcast scienti\\x0cc\\ndata directly to ground stations over which it is passing. The ground stations also have\\nan S-band uplink capability for spacecraft and science instrument operations. The\\nS-band communication subsystem also can communicate through NASA\\'s TDRSS127\\nsynchronous satellites in order to periodically track the spacecraft, calculate the orbit\\nprecisely, and issue commands to adjust the orbit to maintain it within de\\x0cned limits.\\nSensor complement\\nThe Aura instrument package provides complementary observations from the UV to\\nthe microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum with unprecedented sensitivity\\nand depth of coverage to the study of the Earth\\'s atmospheric chemistry from its sur-\\nface to the stratosphere. MLS is on the front of the spacecraft (the forward velocity\\ndirection) while HIRDLS, TES, and OMI are mounted on the nadir side, Fig. 1-b.\\nHIRDLS (High-Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder) observes global distributions of\\ntemperature and trace gas concentrations of O3,H2O,CH 4,N2O,HNO 3,NO 2,\\nN2O5,CFC 11,CFC 12andClONO 2, and aerosols in the upper troposphere, strato-\\nsphere, and mesosphere plus water vapour, aerosol, and cloud tops. Complete Earth\\ncoverage (including polar night) can be obtained in 12 hours.\\nMLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) instrument measures thermal emissions from the\\natmospheric limb in submillimeter and millimetre wavelength spectral bands and is\\nintended for studies of the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere chemistry, mon-\\nitoring of ozone chemistry and observation of e\\x0bects of volcanoes on global change.\\nOMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) instrument is a a nadir-viewing UV/VIS imag-\\ning spectrograph which measures the solar radiation backscattered by the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere and surface over the entire wavelength range from 270 to 500 nm, with a\\nspectral resolution of about 0.5 nm. The design is of GOME heritage, \\rown on ERS-\\n2, as well as of SCIAMACHY and GOMOS heritage, \\rown on Envisat. The overall\\nobjective is to monitor ozone and other trace gases and to monitor tropospheric pollu-\\ntants worldwide. Its measurements are highly synergistic with the HIRDLS and MLS\\ninstruments on the Aura platform. The OMI observations provide mapping of ozone\\ncolumns, measurement of key air quality components, distinctions between aerosol\\ntypes, such as smoke, dust, and sulphates.\\nTES (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer) instrument is of ATMOS (ATLAS), and\\nAES (Airborne Emission Spectrometer) heritage and it has been developed for NASA\\nby JPL. TES is a high-resolution infrared imaging Connes-type FTS (Fourier Trans-\\nform Spectrometer), with the capability to make both limb and nadir observations.\\nTES is a pointable instrument; it can access any target within 45\\x0eof the local vertical,\\nor produce regional transects up to 885 kmin length without any gaps in coverage.\\nTES employs both, the natural thermal emission of the surface and atmosphere,\\nand re\\rected sunlight, thereby providing day and night coverage anywhere on the\\nglobe.Acronyms\\nADCS Attitude Determination and Control System\\nADS Attitude Determination and System\\nAuRA Autonomous Robot Architecture\\nbiTH Bipropellant Thruster\\nCER Cost Estimating Relationship\\nC&DH Command and Data Handling\\ncgTH Cold Gas Thruster\\nCOG Center Of Gravity\\nCOTS Commercial O\\x0b The Shelf\\nCMG Control Moment Gyro\\nDH Data Handling\\nDR Data Rate\\nEDRS European Data Relay System\\nEIP Evaluate Input Parameters\\nEOL End Of Life\\nEPS Electrical Power System\\nGCE General Constrains Evaluation\\nGSGround Station\\nhTH Hydrazine Thruster130 Acknowledgments\\nILIteration Loop\\nIMU Inertial Measurement Unit\\nLEO Low Earth Orbit\\nMDO Multidisciplinary Design Optimization\\nMSAP Multiple Spacecrafts Assembly Procedure\\nMT Magnetorquer\\nNE Nash Equilibrium\\nPO Payo\\x0b\\nPSO Particle Swarm Optimization\\nRSRecipient Satellite\\nRW Reaction Wheel\\nSAP Satellite Assembly Procedure\\nSESystem Evaluation\\nSSSource Satellite\\nSTStar Tracker\\nTCS Thermal Control System\\nTDRS Tracking and Data Relay Satellite\\nTRL Technology Readiness Level\\nTT&C Telemetry Tracking and Command\\nVPS Visual Positioning System\\nWCC Worst Case Cold\\nWCH Worst Case HotAcknowledgments\\nDunque, i ringraziamenti.\\nTrovarmi di nuovo a scrivere questo capitolo lascia una vaga sensazione di d\\x13 ej\\x12 a vu che\\nnon ha niente a che fare con il gatto nero che ha appena attraversato la stanza.

Hello, Oompa Loompas of science!\\nSheldon Lee Cooper, Ph.D.Summary\\nDesign, Simulation, Management and Control of a Cooperative,\\nDistributed, Earth-Observation Satellite System\\nRiccardo Lombardi\\nThe research presented in this thesis explores the potential of, and develops a frame-\\nwork for, the application of fractionated satellite systems to science-dedicated Earth\\nobservation missions. The label fractioned satellites highlights the physical distribu-\\ntion of the functionalities of the spacecraft (e.g. power generation, telecommunica-\\ntion, etc.) over a cluster of orbiting elements. The resultant distributed system can\\nbe seen as a free-\\rying payload supported by free-\\rying service modules. In gen-\\neral, the paradigm shift towards using a multiple-satellite cluster has been fuelled by\\nthe perceived advantages of increased robustness, greater \\rexibility, and in order to\\naccomplish the large-scale geometries imposed by speci\\x0cc science objectives. Small\\ndistributed spacecraft could also guarantee better coverage than monolithic with al-\\nmost comparable performances due to sensors miniaturisation. There are many ways\\nto implement the fractionation; by interpreting literally the idea, it is possible to\\nde-couple entirely the subsystems using di\\x0berent modules thus creating a completely\\nheterogeneous system. In order to cut down the costs it seems reasonable to produce\\nstandard buses for every subsystems. Nonetheless a complete functional decomposi-\\ntion with the current technology not only is impractical, it is physically impossible.\\nEvery module must be able to provide by itself to basic functionality like power\\ndistribution or thermal control as well as structural integrity. Thus the most logic\\ncon\\x0cguration for a fractionated spacecraft is a combination of shared resources and\\nmodule-owned properties. Apart from design issue, operation phase poses a new\\nclass of challenges by itself: the introduction of the fractionated approach requires\\na new methodology to control and coordinate the spacecraft system e\\x0borts in order\\nto guarantee that remote resources will be gathered and distributed according to the\\nsatellites needs; furthermore the proposed concept has been thought to be scalable to134 Summary\\nlarge systems, possibly involving tenth of di\\x0berent elements. The operational costs\\nof monitoring and commanding a large \\reet of close-orbiting satellites is likely to\\nbe unreasonable unless the on-board software is su\\x0eciently autonomous, robust, and\\nre-con\\x0cgurable. As the goal of this research is to develop a methodology to design\\nand simulate distributed satellite systems but no satellites with fractioned architec-\\nture actually exist, frameworks tailored to address this unique concept have to be\\ndeveloped and, in order to compare the performances of the fractionated system with\\nthe corresponding monolithic satellite, objective quantities have to be evaluated, like\\nthe total cost of the spacecraft including estimated development and research, ground\\nsupport, construction, integration and launch.\\nFor the design phase, several topics have been investigated, ranging from auto-\\nmated satellite design, analysis and evaluation of distributed resources, optimisation\\ntechniques. The \\x0crst step has been the creation and validation of a monolithic-satellite\\naimed design tool able to assemble science-dedicated LEO satellite with a reasonable\\ndegree of con\\x0cdence given informations about payload, mission and additional con-\\nstraints like speci\\x0cc launchers or ground stations. Fundamental requirements for\\nthe tool are the capacities to provide subsystems power and mass budgets, main\\ncomponents list and reliabilities. A validation campaign using existing satellites as\\nreference has been conducted. Then the capacity to handle fractioned resources has\\nbeen introduced by requirements and hardware modi\\x0ccations. Considered fractioned\\nsubsystems are power generation and transfer by means of lasers, distributed commu-\\nnication and data processing and remote attitude determination. Finally a particle\\nbased optimisation method has been used to evaluate whose combination of num-\\nber of satellites, shared resources and original requirements, derived from the mission\\npayloads, could exhibit highest \\x0ctness values. The optimisation algorithm highlighted\\nthat only distributed communication and data handling could, in some cases, allow\\nfor a cost reduction whereas the reduced e\\x0eciency of the present day wireless energy\\ntransmission methods penalises this kind of solution. Analogously the shared attitude\\ndetermination is not attractive due its complex implementation without signi\\x0ccant\\nperformances improvement.\\nThe operation phase is aimed at simulate the behaviour of the satellite during\\nits orbit; due to the particular features introduced by the fractionation, it has been\\nmodelled to consider the additional e\\x0bects introduced by fractionation, mainly the\\nfact that resources and users are not necessarily co-located within the same satellite\\nthus a strategy to enable and control the remote access to means must be provided.\\nThe capacity to replicate has been the \\x0crst step; included elements in the simulation\\nframework are orbit and attitude evolution including e\\x0bects due to disturbances and\\ncontrols, power subsystem, with evaluations of generated, consumed and available\\npower; communication subsystems, including long and short range connections; ther-\\nmal subsystem, able to evaluate the satellite components temperature and to control\\nthem using heaters; propulsion subsystem; attitude control system with simpli\\x0ced ac-\\ntuator models whose used power and propellant a\\x0bect power and propulsion systems135\\nrespectively; GNC algorithms. Considerable attention has been given to subsystems\\nmutual in\\ruences, identi\\x0ced through a priory analysis. Additional features to ac-\\ncount for multiple satellite simulations have been included, as a cooperation model\\nfor communication, relative attitude and position evaluation and the upgrade of GNC\\nalgorithm to manage several spacecraft. In particular a game theory based schema has\\nbeen used to coordinate satellites e\\x0borts and share autonomously the communication\\nresources.\\nOptimisation and simulated operation phase highlighted possible advantages and\\ndrawbacks of the fractionated concept: unlike the remote power transfer and attitude\\ndetermination, shared communications and data handling could allow a cost reduc-\\ntion and performances improvement. However the already commissioned data relay\\nsystems could achieve similar objectives thus reducing the need for on-purpose com-\\nmunication modules and making the traditional con\\x0cguration, with a certain margin,\\nthe optimal solution when costs are used to evaluate the performances. A comparison\\nof di\\x0berent con\\x0cgurations to achieve extended design life also resulted that conven-\\ntional approach takes advantage from the limited increase in launch and operation\\ncosts whereas fractioned satellites not only have to exploit multiple launchers but their\\nconstruction cost is signi\\x0ccantly in\\ruenced by research and development expenses.\\nFurther studies will address the development of an increased accuracy cost model\\nin\\ruenced by failure probability and the improvement of design and simulation frame-\\nworks.'),\n",

SCOPE  \\n \\n1.1 Purpose  \\n \\nThis NASA Technical Standard establish es the fracture control requirements for National \\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) human -rated spaceflight hardware. In \\naccordance with  NASA Procedural Requirement s (NPR) 8705.2B, Human -Rating Requirements \\nfor Space Systems, it is NASA’s policy to produce  human -rated space system s that have  failure \\ntolerance for catastrophi c events or that potentially catastrophic hazards  are controlled through a \\ndefined process in w hich approved standards and margins are implemented that account for the \\nabsence of failure tolerance . \\n \\nPrograms that are not human -rated may choose to impose these requirements on a mission or \\nhardware to bolster the program or to serve as  a stepping -stone for human rating . \\n \\n1.2 Applicability  \\n \\nThis NASA Technical Standard is applicable to human -rated  spaceflight hardware.  \\n \\nThis NASA Technical Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers \\nand Facilities , and applicable technical requirements may be cited in contract, program, and other \\nAgency documents. It may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally Funded \\nResearch and Development Center [FFRDC ]), other contractors , recipients of grants and \\ncooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements  only to the extent specified or \\nreferenced in applicable contracts , grants, or agreements . \\n \\nVerifiable r equirement statements are designated by the acronym “FCR” (Fracture Control \\nRequirements), numbere d, and indicated by the word “shall”  beginning in section 4.  This NASA \\nTechnical Standard contains 26 requirements. Explanatory or guidance text is indicated in italics \\nbeginning in section 4.  To facilitate requirements selection and verification by NASA p rograms \\nand projects, a Requirements Compliance Matrix is provided in Appendix A. \\n \\n1.3 Tailoring  \\n \\nTailoring of  the requirements in  this NASA Technical Standard for application to a specific \\nprogram or project shall be formally documented as part of program or project requirements and \\napproved by the delegated  Technical Authority in accordance with NPR 7120.5, NASA Space \\nFlight Progra m and Project Management Requirements.  \\n NASA -STD -5019A  w/CHANGE 3\\n  \\nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED  \\n \\n9 of 119 Technical Authority in this context may vary from program to program. In accordance with NPR \\n7120.10, Technical Standards for NASA Programs and Projects, section 2.2.4, “ The NASA \\nChief Engineer, the Chief, Safety and  Mission Assurance, and the Chief Health and  \\nMedical Officer serve as or may delegate Technical Authority for all technical standards within \\ntheir areas of responsibility.”  \\n \\n1.4 Overview  \\n \\nThis document provides the hardware developer with the requirements , rationale, and \\nmethodologies to implement fracture control requirements. It also provides a guide to the \\nResponsible Fracture Control Board (RFCB) when reviewing the Fracture Control Plan (FCP).   \\n \\nThis document contains 26 requirements that are numbered  as Fracture Control Requirement s \\n[FCR s] and that begin in section 4. These requirements use the word “shall .” Narrative text and \\nrequirement rationale are provided in italic format beginning in section 4. Narrative text is \\nprovided as guidance for the ass ociated requirement. It is recommended that fracture control \\npractitioners become familiar with all portions of this NASA Technical Standard.   \\n \\nThe FCRs are summarized and briefly described in table 1 , Overview  of Fractur e Control \\nRequirements  in NASA -STD -5019A . Figure 1 , NASA -STD -5019A Fracture Control \\nRequirements Diagram , shows a diagram of the FCRs and the section in this NASA Technical \\nStandard in which that particular FCR appears.  \\n \\nA viable fracture control program relies on design, analysis , testing,  non-destructive evaluation \\n(NDE ), and tracking of fracture  critical hardware. It is expected that all spaceflight hardware will \\nbe manufactured consistent with industr y or aerospace  standards, practices, and quality. It is \\nbeyond the scope or in tent of this document to address technical or quality disciplines that should \\nalready exist and be in place regardless of fracture control. Fracture control is imposed and \\nrequired , not to correct deficiencies in other disciplines, rather  to enhance the sa fety and mission \\nreliability of systems by reducing the risk of catastrophic failure caused by  the presence of flaws.  \\n \\nNASA -HDBK -5010 , Fracture Control Implementation Handbook for Payloads, Experiments, \\nand Similar Hardware,  contains examples and additiona l guidance for interpretation and \\nimplementation of the requirements of this Standard. NASA -HDBK -5010 , Revision A , is under \\ndevelopment and may not be released at the time of publication of this NASA Technical \\nStandard. Before  the release of NASA -HDBK -5010 A, the current handbook may provide interim \\nguidance for applying this NASA Technical Standard. Note that NASA -HDBK -5010A will \\ninclude guidelines for NASA -STD -5019A and will likely undergo a title change to reflect a \\nbroader scope than payloads and experim ents.

Specifies fracture  controls that are establis hed to mitigate the risk of catastrophic \\nfailure caused by  flaws throughout the service life of the hardware.   \\n \\nd. Has a pproval by the RFCB.  \\n \\n[Rationale: The FCP is necessary to document the hardware -specific fracture control \\nrequirements , such as parts classification, selected approaches for each part, and all required \\nfracture control activities  for the program or project. The RFCB -approved FCP is the working \\ndocument that all responsible parties u se for implementing fracture control requ irements to a \\nparticular program or project.]  \\n \\nThe FCP details  the fracture control responsibilities, the classification of all parts for the \\nspecific hardware,  the selected applicable fracture control  approaches from the requirements of \\nthis NASA Technical Standard  corresponding to each part’s category , as well as the approaches \\nfor flaw screening, traceability, and material selection of fracture critical parts.

The RFCB may accept other items as exempt based on rigorous \\ndevelopment programs that establish their  safety and functional reliability.  \\n \\nNon-structural parts are generally those n ot intended to resist loads.

Also, this \\nclassification is intended for hardware designed to carry primarily pressure  loads . This \\nhardware is usually designed with appropriate supports, brackets , or relie f loops such that the \\nhardware  is not subject to significant structural loads.

This presumes the ha rdware manufacturing process has no credible \\nrisk of producing initial flaws longer than the crack,  and leakage through the crack  is shown to \\nreduce pressure before loadings could grow the crack to cause fracture. The analysis, taking into \\naccount applied loads and residual stress effects, shows that  the crack will leak and not be \\nunstable.

This \\npresents a significant effort for the developer of the FCP and for the RFCB reviews.  \\n \\nb. The development approach is satisfied by comparison to requirements in sections \\n7.2.1 in this NASA Technical Standard for metallic pressure  vessels or 7.2.2 in this NASA \\nTechnical Standard for COPVs and composite overwrapped pressurized fluid containers. The \\napproach is to be equivalent to or an extension of all the requirements, including establishing that \\ndamage tolerance life is achieved w ithout failure or leakage of the fluid, and provides equivalent \\nrisk mitigation of a catastrophic failure caused by flaws.  \\n \\nc. The proposed FCP approach for damage tolerance assessment  of a fracture critical \\npressure vessel or pressurized fluid container t hat is all  composite or has a non -metallic , i.e., an \\nelastomeric , liner or other non -metallic components is to meet the general approach for fracture \\ncritical comp osite hardware in section 7.4 in this NASA Technical Standard and show that the \\ndamage tolera nce required life is achieved without failure or leakage of the fluid.   \\n \\nd. The proposed FCP approach for damage tolerance assessment  of a fracture critical  \\nall-metal pressurized fluid container is to meet the general approach for fracture critical met allic \\nhardware in section 7.3 in this NASA Technical Standard and show that the damage tolerance \\nlife is achieved without failure or leakage of the fluid.  \\n \\nNote  that if  a fracture critical metallic \"pressurized fluid container\" is planned with attributes \\nclose to the definition of a pressure vessel, it may be advantageous to push it into the pressure \\nvessel category to minimize later impacts as the project matures in case the initial design \\nattributes increase.  \\n \\nThere are currently no predefined approaches  for pressure vessels or pressurized fluid \\ncontainers that are qualified under a different code/standard than ANSI/ AIAA S-080 or \\nANSI/ AIAA S-081, such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code , Section VIII , Divisions  1 \\nor 2, or the United States Departme nt of Transportation  Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 , \\nTransportation . These codes/standards do not impose the structural integrity activities needed \\nfor damage tolerance that are  specified in ANSI/ AIAA S-080 and ANSI/ AIAA S-081. As a result, \\nthe approaches used by these codes/standards to certify vessels do not facilitate meeting damage \\ntolerance requirements as required in this NASA Technical  Standard . Equivalence means that \\ndamage tolerance life analysis or test requireme nts in sections 7.2.1 or 7.2.2 in the NASA \\nTechnical  Standard are also applied in modified form for a vessel meeting section 7.2.3  in this \\nNASA Technical  Standard . Equivalence does not mean other types of assessment, such as fatigue NASA -STD -5019A  w/CHANGE 3\\n  \\nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED  \\n \\n65 of 119 calculations or cycle t est, can be substituted for the damage tolerance methodology detailed in \\nsections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2  in this NASA Technical  Standard . Use of these codes/standards in \\ncombination with other activities  may be proposed , however,  as an alternative approach as \\ndescribed in [FCR 26] in section 10  in this NASA Technical  Standard . \\n \\nIn addition, other pressure vessels and pressurized fluid containers may be developed that are \\nnot addressed by existing codes or standards. Examples may include composite  pressure \\nvessels /containers without a metal liner or rubber -lined composite pressure vessels/containers .  \\n \\nFor these other fracture critical vessels/containers, a unique approach is developed and \\nproposed in the FCP that establishes equivalent methods of addressing material, structural, \\nqualification, acceptance, and related aspects such as those in the ANSI/ AIAA S -080 or \\nANSI/ AIAA S -081 standards to support the damage tolerance assessment. Equivalence with \\nthe AIAA pressure vessel standards may include assessments and testing that include  \\nmaterials aspects,  loadings, stress analysis, strength, environment effec ts, stiffness, thermal \\nresponse, life, quality assurance, repairs, NDE requirements, acceptance processes including \\nproof and leakage testing, damage tolerance control plans , and damage tolerance \\nassessments by analysis and/or testing, and documentation . However, use of analytical \\ntechniques to establish damage tolerance is generally considered insufficiently developed for \\ncomposite pressure vessels. For all -composite pressure vessels, the approaches described for fracture \\ncritical composite hardware in sec tion 7.4 in the NASA Technical  Standard should be incorporated , \\nin addition to applicable equivalent requirements in ANSI/ AIAA S-081.    \\n \\nFor other types of vessels/containers, it should also be noted that , in addition to the section 9 \\ndocumentation in thi s NASA Technical  Standard showing the approach proposed in the FCP has \\nbeen met, section 9.1.3.1 in this NASA Technical Standard requires providing supporting \\ndetailed technical information to the RFCB upon request , including drawings, material and \\nprocessing data, detailed stress analys is, and damage tolerance analyses  that are needed to \\nsupport the damage tolerance assessment.  \\n \\nEarly involvement with the RFCB is suggested for any vessels/containers to be assessed b y this \\nsection .  \\n \\n7.2.4  Fracture Critical Lines, Fittings, and Other Pressurized Components  \\n \\nFor metallic fracture critical lines, fittings, and other pressurized components (hardware items \\nthat are part of a pressurized system , including valves, filters, regulators, heat pipes, and heat \\nexchangers) that transfer hazardous fluids or when loss of pressurization results in a catastrophic \\nhazard , to satisfy requirement [FCR 11 ] section 7.2.d in this NASA Technical Standard,  meet  \\neither 7.2.4. a or 7.2.4. b (below) . \\n \\na.

The \\nrequirement is necessary to mitigate risk of failure because of  flaws  that may stil l exist after \\nimplementation of  flaw screening  strategies. Fatigue -crack -growth  empirical data have inherent \\nscatter. When performing damage tolerance assessments, mean values are used , not a statistical \\nlower bound. In addition, the predicti on procedures have uncertainties relate d to the local stress \\nlevels, stress -intensity factor calculations, load spectra, and environmental effects. Errors in \\nlocal stresses and stress -intensity factor calculations are grossly magnified when crack growth \\nrates are evaluated while using the Paris growth law. Slight misjudgments of the spectrum can \\nlead to large effect s on crack growth. To account for all of these effects , a safety factor is applied \\non the predicted life. Thus, the life factor of 4 provides ma rgin on uncertainties in analysis, \\nprediction methodologies , and material property variations.

FLAW SCREENING, TRAC EABILITY, AND MATERI AL \\nSELECTION  \\n \\n[FCR 15] All fracture critical parts  shall be screened for flaws with methods and techniques \\nidenti fied in the FCP.  \\n \\n[Rationale: An understanding of the flaws or damage  types to be screened and the methods to be \\nused is necessary to assure adequate fracture control implementation.]  \\n \\nNDE is the primary method used for screening flaws  for fracture critical parts . Proof test of the \\nflight article may be used to screen for flaws in special cases, especially for glass elements. \\nVisual inspection is an NDE method that is frequently used for inspecting composite  or bonded \\nparts for damage, in addition to other NDE  methods . Visual inspection is also used for \\ninspecting optical elements for flaws, often in addition to proof testing. In some  cases, process \\ncontrol may be allowed as a method for establishing an upper bound on flaw si zes that may be \\npresent in the part. \\n \\n8.1 Flaw Screening  \\n \\n8.1.1 NDE for Metallic  Parts  \\n \\n[FCR 16] Metallic fracture critical parts  screened with NDE shall have inspections performed in \\naccordance with NASA -STD -5009  and include the following for flaw screening by NDE:  \\n NASA -STD -5019A  w/CHANGE 3\\n  \\nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED  \\n \\n89 of 119 a.

In addition to NDE for flaw screening of other regions of fracture critical parts, \\nperform post -proof test NDE at critical welds and other critical locations identified in the FCP \\nfor all parts that are proof tested as a part of acceptance , i.e., critical hardware  locations not \\nscreened for specific flaws with  the proof test . \\n \\n[Rationale: This cites NASA -STD -5009  and reduces the potential for redundant or conflicting \\nrequirements.]  \\n \\nIt is expected that fracture critical parts have surface and volumetric inspections unless there is \\nrationale that it is not necessary. The need for internal (volumetric) inspection depends on \\napplication and materials characteristics such as thickness, pr oduct form, and other factors. \\nInternal inspection requirements and methods should be determined early in the design process \\nso that proper flaw screening is accomplished.  \\n \\nAccording to NASA -STD-5009, the flaw sizes and shapes that are evaluated in the hardware \\ndamage tolerance assessment are based on 90 -percent probability of detection with 95-percent \\nconfidence (90/95 or better) flaw detection capability.  \\n \\nIf one NDE method cannot adequately examine a part, additional NDE methods may be needed. \\nIf there are multiple types of flaws or complex geometry to assess, additional NDE may be \\nneeded. If there is uncertainty about which NDE methods or results for a particular part are to \\nbe used to define flaws for the damage tolerance assessment, conservative choices are to be \\nmade . \\n \\nNDE activities and damage tolerance assessment activities should be coordinated to assure flaw \\nscreen ing occurs in the way inte nded. \\n \\n8.1.2  NDE  for Composite  or Bonded  Parts  \\n \\nNDE activities for composite or bonded  materials requirements apply to fracture critical and  \\nNFC parts. Because of  the potential sensitivity to impact dam age and flaws for  these types of \\nmaterials , additional activities are necessary  for NFC parts  in accordance with [FCR 9] 6.3. c in \\nthis NASA Technical  Standard . \\n \\n[FCR 17] For composite or bonded  materials , the hardware  developer shall :  \\n \\na.

The approach for NDE of other materials needs to b e documented and fully \\nexplained within the FCP.]   \\n \\nInspection of composite or bonded parts is to meet the intent of MIL -HDBK -6870 , \\nNondestructive Inspection Program Requirements for Aircraft and Missile Materials and Parts , \\nas required in NASA -STD-6016 . \\n \\nHardware should receive post -proof NDE unless a special RFCB approval has been granted.  \\n \\nGeneral ly, the NDE approach  and rationale for all materials should address which indications \\nrise to the level of a reportable flaw.  For signal -based methods, such as ultrasonic inspections, \\nNDE acceptance criteria are usually necessary  to discern whether the signal responses warrant \\nnonconformance reporting . All damage indication s from visual inspection are reportable. \\nWorkmanship stan dards for visual inspection should define acceptance criteria, e.g., porosity, \\nsurface texture, geometric contours. NDE acceptance criteria may be developed by analysis with \\nsupporting coupon test data for the appropriate material type.  Prior approval shou ld be \\nobtained from the RFCB when visual inspection is used as a flaw -screening technique for \\nfracture control.  Screening of a low-risk part with NDE should be considered when it is \\nplausible for that part to be reclassified as  a fracture critical  part.  A part may need to be \\nreclassified when it is plausible for that part to be accepted for flight with out -of-tolerance \\ndimensions or nonstandard material properties.  \\n \\n8.1.3  Proof Test  \\n \\n[FCR 18] If proof testing is used as the flaw screening technique for fracture critical parts , the \\napproach  shall be documented in the FCP with rationale establishing  that it is an applicable \\napproach that has been approved by the RFCB.  \\n \\n[Rationale: Proof test may be used for flaw screening. However, few parts, materials, an d \\napplications lend themselves to a simple proof test strategy. Environmental effects, temperature, \\ntest fixture, inertial loads, and other complexities require careful consideration before accepting \\nproof as the sole method for flaw screening. If proof te st is used for flaw screening, an \\nunderstanding of the planned approach and anticipated effectiveness needs to be approved by \\nthe RFCB and documented in the FCP.]  \\n NASA -STD -5019A  w/CHANGE 3\\n  \\nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED  \\n \\n91 of 119 Proof test should not be used as the only flaw screening method for composite or bonded \\nhardware.  \\n \\nThe flaw size used in the life assessment should adequately account for flaw growth during the \\nproof test.  To establish that  the assessment is valid, sufficient test data should be obtained using \\npre-flawed specimens that are representative of t he part configuration, materia l conditions, and \\nscreened flaw  and show the amount of growth of all crack fronts during the proof test from all \\nsources, including stable tearing, and both EAC  and SLC if applicable, ha ve been conservatively \\nbounded.  \\n \\nWhen it  is judged that a proof test is appropriate to screen hardware  for flaws, the proof test \\nshould occur at the in -service temperature and environment. If this is not feasible, an ECF can \\nbe used as approved by the RFCB.  Upper  bound critical stress intensity  or residual strength \\nshould be used when establishing an analytical ly predicted flaw size  screened  by proof test.  \\n \\nNote that a proof test is required for acceptance in accordance with NASA -STD-5001 (or \\nprogram -specific requirements), with a minimum proof t est factor , depending upon whether a \\nprototype or proto -flight verification approach is followed and the type of material  used. \\n \\n8.1.4  Process Control  \\n \\n[FCR 19] If process controls are used to establish bounds on flaw sizes in fracture critical parts,  \\nthe approach  shall be subject to the following:  \\n \\na. The approach is d ocument ed in the FCP . \\nb. The rationale establishing  that the approach is applicable  is documented in the FCP . \\nc. The FCP is approv ed by the RFCB.  \\n \\n[Rationale: Use of process control information to define flaws or d amage  that could be in the \\npart is an  unusual approach. An understanding of the approach and supporting information need \\nto be approved by the RFCB and documented in the FCP.]  \\n \\nProcess control rationale to bound flaw sizes submitted for RF CB approval should include \\ndocumentation on why this  approach is being applied, an overview of the hardware , and \\nevaluation  that the approach is adequate for fracture control. Description s of the relevant \\nmanufacturer’s experience base, process control dur ing manufacture , inspection results, and \\nsubsequent life of the component, all component testing, and summary arguments  should be \\nincluded .  \\n  \\n8.1.5  Detected Flaws  \\n \\n[FCR 20] Space flight hardware with detected flaws that is used for flight without being repaired \\nor replaced shall have a specific detailed assessment approach documented with rationale in the \\nFCP that contains the following:  \\n NASA -STD -5019A  w/CHANGE 3\\n  \\nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED  \\n \\n92 of 119 a.

An assessment approach for composite or bonded  parts with detected flaws is to \\ninclude the following items : \\n \\n(1) The approach and rationale provided to the RFCB for approval before \\nimplementation.  \\n \\n(2) Document ation of  the approved approach in the FCP.  \\n \\n[Rationale: An understanding of the approach and methodology  to accept detected flaws , which \\naccount s for variability in the assessment,  is necessary to assure adequate fracture control \\nimplementation.]  \\n \\nFor reportable d etected flaws in composite or bonded parts, a similar worst -case analysis \\napproach to that used for metal parts may not be available. Any proposed analysis approach is \\nto be test verified with a similar damage configuration and approved by the RFCB.  \\n \\nNote that the detailed assessment approach may be by damage tolerance test if approved by the \\nRFCB.  \\n \\nThe normal fracture control process is carried out with the assumption that the part contains a \\nflaw in the worst -case location and orientation. The assessment of the assumed flaw includes \\ntypical fracture properties and an assumed flaw size. However, when flaws are detect ed in a part \\nthat is planned for use in flight , an assessment is performed using bounding flaw sizes, material \\nproperties, loads, and boundary conditions .  \\n \\nFracture critical parts with reportable NDE indications  are to be assessed by a process \\napproved by the Technical Authority to determine whether the indication is a flaw.  \\n \\nFracture critical parts with detected flaws are to be  assessed with an  approach that satisfies \\n[FCR 20] and then evaluated by the Technical Authority to determine whether the part is \\nacceptable to use as is or if the part is to be repaired or replaced. If the part is to be repaired, \\nthe repair process is to be an established , proven process that has been approved for this \\npurpose by the Technical Authority.  \\n  \\nPressure vessels and COPVs should not be  flown with detected flaws , e.g., see section s 7.2.1 and \\n7.2.2  in this NASA Technical  Standard .
